Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in "Clinical Psychology" is the natural continuation, deepening and developing in a professional sense of the 1st cycle courses, namely of class 24.
The main objective of the Course is to train psychologists, qualified for professional practice, with specific skills for the psychological-clinical intervention on individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities.
Starting from a deepening of the basic psychological knowledge already acquired, and in the perspective of an integrated approach between theoretical and applicative skills in the clinical-relational field and in the field of neuropsychological research, the Degree Course aims at providing skills related:
-	 to the evaluation and prevention, treatment and care of people, families, groups, organizations, communities; 
-	to the promotion of health, development and well-being; 
-	to the field of research.
The two curricula, "Relation and Care" and "Neuropsychology", provide a strong common educational core, in the first year, and a specialized second-year articulation, which aims to define in a specific and professionalizing way the clinical-relational and neuropsychological skills, in accordance with the needs of the labour market.
Specific training objectives of the 2nd cycle Degree in Clinical Psychology are:
- the updated knowledge of the main explanatory theories of normal psychological functioning and of psychopathological distress, from the point of view of clinical-relational research (with particular reference to psychodynamic and group models), as well as of the most recent acquisitions in the field of neuroscience;
- learning the ability to evaluate, diagnose and assess mental functioning and the relational dynamics of people, families, groups, organizations, and also of the main neuropsychological syndromes, techniques and neuropsychological diagnosis;
- the knowledge of the clinical-relational and neuro-rehabilitation methods and the ability to draw up appropriate clinical reports for communication with colleagues and other professionals (eg social workers, psychiatrists, operators, etc.), as well as with the users themselves;
- the knowledge of the clinical psychology research methods, based on the evaluation of outcome, process and context (setting);
- the learning of the ability to define the case and to provide adequate therapeutic indications, within evidence-based protocols, applicable in the different care settings.
To achieve these objectives, the Course in Clinical Psychology provides educational activities related to the field of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, General and Physiological Psychology, Social and Industrial Psychology.
Related and integrative training activities are also provided, aimed at completing the professional profile through the deepening of advanced, specialist and current issues of the psychology sector, consistent with the needs of the labour market.
The qualifying degree course in Clinical Psychology LM-51 also includes among the specific educational objectives, aimed at the technical training for the qualification to practice the profession, as required by the law of 8 November 2021/163, the development of professional skills such as:
- the appropriate use of psychodiagnostics tools aimed at carrying out an analysis of the clinical characteristics of the subject within their own life context;
- the design of an evidence-based clinical intervention, based on an optimal cost/benefit ratio;
- knowledge and understanding of the ethical and deontological aspects of the profession of psychologist and the management of conflicts associated with these dimensions in psychological intervention;
- the management of the clinical relationship with the patient/user within a specific organizational and institutional context.
In this context, within the activities of the practical-evaluation internship (TPV), personal training experiences are offered, in group contexts, oriented towards the acquisition of awareness of the importance of the relationship as the main work and intervention tool in clinical psychology.
Teaching is based on the integration of frontal teachings, educational laboratories, and TPV experiences.
Interactive and practical training methods (such as role-playing, case presentations, simulations, experiential laboratories) will be used within all the teachings envisaged by the course to facilitate the acquisition of the professional training objectives.
The professional training objectives for the exercise of the profession of psychologist will be pursued over the two years and evaluated through the experience of TPV carried out in qualified external operational contexts and affiliated with the University.
The qualifying degree in Clinical Psychology LM-51 is also the access key to II level Master courses, specific training courses, PhD courses and Graduate schools in psychotherapy.
