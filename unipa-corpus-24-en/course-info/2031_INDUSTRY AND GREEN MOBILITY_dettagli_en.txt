Educational objectives
The course aims at training engineers with specific competences in the design, building and management of systems for the production, distribution and use of electric power, as well as of their components, in the relevant environmental, economic, regulatory and safety implications, and able to operate in all the industrial and service activities, (even not strictly electrical ones), where electric power is an important aspect and to interpret, describe, identify, formulate and solve, in innovative ways and with interdisciplinary approach too, complex problems as well as to ideate, plan, design and manage complex and/or innovative systems, processes, tests and services.
The educational programme, continuing the training provided in the 1st cycle degree course, contains advanced teachings broadening the concepts, content, methodology and planning methodology (with the help of advanced analytical and numerical techniques) in the typical electrical engineering sectors (Electrical Engineering, Electric power systems, Converters, Electric machines and activations, Electrical and electronic measurements), thanks also to the core and applicative support provided by teachings of other disciplinary areas (Numerical analysis, Electronics, Automation).
Curricular courses are integrated by seminars providing competences related to the business-economic culture, with respect in particular to specific applications and to professional ethics.
The received training enables graduates to access the labour market or to continue with higher educational programmes (university master courses, PhD courses).
The educational programme consists of frontal teachings, theoretical and laboratory practice, seminars, technical visits, stage and internships, with the help of teaching materials specified or provided by the teachers in hard copy or electronic format, and available on the Course website
