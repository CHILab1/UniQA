Educational objectives
The Degree course aims at training a design technician capable of working in industrial product design as well as in the communication for companies, public agencies, cultural and environmental heritage. The course Is centred on the acquisition of design methodology and practice in the various design areas, together with educational phases related to the theoretical-historical knowledge of the culture of design, the evolution of technologies, the analysis of markets and lifestyle evolution, as well as to environmental sustainability. The objective is the creation of a planning attitude which Is sensible to innovative processes and, at the same time, aware of the importance that such a design technician may take for the development and glamorisation of local resources.
Given the broad and diversified field of application of these skills the course might be later one divided in different curricula
The educational programme focuses on thematic  design studios, through the following qualifying passages:
-	Knowledge of industrial product theories and history and of the design methodologies;
-	Knowledge in the field of social and human sciences with respect to the quality of the artefacts under the point of view of perception and aesthetic experience, of their social and behavioural importance as well as of the environmental sustainability;
-	Technical scientific knowledge with respect to the innovation of materials, to their potentialities and applications, to production processes and product engineering, and to quality certifications;
-	Knowledge of business organisation, of consumer analysis, of marketing and communication strategies;
-	Knowledge of history and cultural transformations, with respect, in particular, to the specific production context, the traits of which will be investigated, as well as the potentialities useful for the experimentation of system and models capable of creating innovation and development; 
-	Written and oral fluency in Italian and English;
The course aims at training expert technicians capable to give their contribution in:
-	The process of research and development of industrial products;
-	The process of business organisation and management;
-	The process of product marketing, with respect also to packaging and communication;
-	The communication of cultural and environmental heritage and of public bodies;

-	The cooperation with advertising design companies;
-	The definition of visual artefact for publishing and advertising graphics and multimedia productions;
-	The cooperation with companies in the field of web design and services.
The course also aims at educating university staff supporting teaching in experimental design workshops for product design and visual communication.
The educational activity is divided in semesters, consisting of single-subject or integrated teachings and of design and experimental workshops.
The educational activity consists of: 
1)	Theoretical frontal teaching;
2)	Practice, workshops and seminars;
3)	Thematic experimental workshops with inspections and visits in production facilities;
4)	Stages in qualified production facilities.
The educational activity might be partly carried out in cooperation with public institutions, scientific research institutions, research and development branches in public or private companies or agencies in various production sectors, through specific agreements which may entail the use of experts of these organisation for special educational activities (intensive courses, stages, seminars).

Professional opportunities
1st cycle graduate in Industrial Design
Functions
Graduates in Industrial Design are professional combining technical-instrumental skills with the ability to develop creative processes, with respect to:
- the design of industrial objects and products;
- the design of visual communication elements (two-dimensional, multimedia, interactive);
- the elaboration of projects and strategies for the enhancement and use of cultural assets and products (exhibitions outfitting, events, planning of services for culture);
- the development of strategies for sustainability in production and use.
skills associated with the function:
- basic theoretical, methodological and technical-instrumental skills for the design of artefacts and industrial products;

- basic theoretical and methodological skills for the design of products and services that transfer technological innovation into new models of production and use of culture;
- basic theoretical, methodological and technical-instrumental skills related to the analysis of production processes, applications of technologies and materials, environmental effects;
Given the breadth of these skills, further articulations of the course in the curriculum are envisaged.
Professional opportunities:
The proposed profile is part of the needs of a rapidly expanding market, requiring technicians trained in industrial product development (product design and packaging), as well as in product or service development related to communication and new communication technologies. (graphic design, web design, multimedia product designer). The employment opportunities for graduates in Industrial Design can be identified as follows, in the private sector, in large companies, small and medium-sized enterprises, professional firms operating in the field of design and communication, service agencies operating in the new technology sectors. In the public sector, they will be able to benefit from the skills of three-year graduates in industrial design: regional and municipal administrations, and other public structures that operate in the field of enhancement and communication of territorial resources (tourist agencies, nature parks, trade fairs). After evaluating the educational curriculum, graduates in Industrial Product Design can also continue their studies in master's degree courses. Such as the LM-12 Design and culture of the territory.
