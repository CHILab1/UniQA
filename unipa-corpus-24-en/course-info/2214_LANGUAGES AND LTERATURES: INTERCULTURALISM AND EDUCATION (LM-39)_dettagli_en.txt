Educational objectives
Specific objectives: 
The 2nd cycle degree course "Languages and Literatures: Interculturality and Education" is addressed, on the one hand, to the teaching of foreign languages in high schools and of Italian as a foreign language in public and private institutions, in Italy and abroad, but also to provide a broad humanistic education, enabling graduates to be competitive to perform other activities: 
cultural operator for the promotion and organization of events of different nature and type, requiring, among other things, knowledge of one or more foreign languages; expert in the field of social inclusion; expert in translation and writing of texts, dossiers and information material; literary consultant, editorial and expert in intercultural mediation in public bodies and voluntary associations, in national and international cultural institutions. 
The training project therefore takes into account the Decree 59/2017 (hence the inclusion of disciplines in the anthropological field, with particular attention to teaching methods, including the Clil methodology). It also provides, through the individual option among related subjects and one elective teaching (including also the Latin, in class LM-39), the foundations of a varied humanistic education, such as not to limit the professional skills of graduates to the only perspective of teaching. 
The expected learning outcomes are: 
-	full command of two languages (level C1 of the CEFR in at least one of the two), with advanced knowledge of the corresponding literatures and cultures;
-	advanced skills with respect to the methodologies of critical and linguistic analysis, as well as of literary comparison;
-	ability to understand the cultural world, expressed by the same languages and literatures, with reference to their historical and geographical context; 
-	acquisition of theoretical and applicative tools for linguistic and discourse analysis, for the teaching of languages and literatures, including Italian as L2; 
-	theoretical-practical reflection on issues related to social inclusion through the knowledge of multilingual repertoires of learners;
-	acquisition of the basic mechanisms regulating linguistic change at the diachronic and synchronic level and of advanced tools aimed at the study of linguistic and intercultural contact, 
-	Acquisition of the fundamental morphological and syntactic structures of medieval texts in vernacular of the Romance or Germanic areas. 
The educational programme also provides for a mandatory period of training in public or private institutions, in Italy or abroad, to increase skills with direct professional experience.
