Educational objectives
The 1st cycle Degree in Chemistry aims at providing basic chemical competences which are important for professional activities requiring familiarity with the scientific method and to train undergraduates capable of applying methods and technologies through the use of specific equipment.
Graduates in Chemistry may widen their competences through 2nd cycle degree courses, university master courses and, after the 2nd cycle, in successive PhD courses and graduate schools. The foremost objective of the course is a sound basic theoretical-experimental training, in accordance with the "Chemistry Eurobachelor" model, proposing educational traits enabling graduates in Chemistry to have access to the greatest possible number of professional opportunities in the scientific and technological fields, and fixing the minimum standards for educational activities. Therefore the course does not provide specific curricula, but complies to the "Chemistry Eurobachelor" model as well as to the model proposed by the Italian Chemical Society, with respect to the "Core chemistry" contents for L-27 courses. The "core" of the course therefore consists of at least 90 credits in the following areas: Mathematics, Physics, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
The teachings aim at providing students with:
•	adequate knowledge of the various sectors of chemistry, such as general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, organic chemistry and analytical chemistry, also in connection with synthesis and characterization methods and structure-property relationships;
•	Adequate basic preparation in mathematics, computer science and physics;
•	The acquisition of defined degrees of autonomy, to integrate promptly into working environments also contributing to activities in the industrial field, in research, control and analysis laboratories, in the sectors of synthesis and characterization of new materials, health, food, the environment and energy, in the conservation of cultural heritage.
•	The possibility of using, in written and oral form, at least one language of the European Union, in the specific area of competence and for the exchange of general information.
The course outline fully supports the achievement of the objectives.
The first year, providing the basic skills in the areas of knowledge that constitute the "core", is followed by a second year in which this knowledge is deepened and applied thanks to practical laboratory activities.
The professional character, enabling graduates to enter the labour market promptly, is broadened and deepened during the third year, in which the laboratory activities are accompanied by the internship activity always carried out at external organizations or companies.
