Educational objectives
This degree course specifically aims at the scientific-professional training of graduates, qualified physiotherapists, and this objective is achieved through theoretical and practical learning aimed at the specificity of the profession according to the contents of Ministerial Decree no. 741/1994 which identifies and regulates the professional profile of the Physiotherapist and through the learning of the disciplines founding the international cultural fields as provided for in the Core Curriculum of the Physiotherapist (see 2008 and subsequent modifications and integrations), such as:
-  Biomolecular science.
-  Morphological science.
-  Physics.
-  Psycho-pedagogic science.
-  Rehabilitation methodology.
-  General pathology and pharmacology
-  Principles and methods of neuro-rehabilitation.
-  Internal and geriatric medicine.
-  Locomotor system rehabilitation.
-  Management.
-  Physiotherapeutic rehabilitation in specialist medicine.
-  Physiotherapeutic rehabilitation in paediatrics.
-  Diagnostics and prevention in healthcare services.
-  General surgery, first aid and emergency.
In the formulation of the Project, the priority is represented by the theoretical/practical study of the Science of Physiotherapy, which is implemented through lectures, exercises, educational laboratories as well as professionalizing Internship in the sectors qualifying Physiotherapy, such as the rehabilitation of the musculoskeletal, neuromotor, cardio-respiratory and visceral systems, in all age groups.
The competence and relational skills necessary to interact with patients, caregivers and the professional system are developed through the teachings in human and psycho-pedagogical sciences aimed at providing those behaviours and attitudes, necessary and fundamental to relate to the person.
The basic activities provide a general preparation in view of an application in the physiotherapy-rehabilitation field. Basic disciplines are specifically related to the knowledge of human anatomy, the physiology of movement systems and other disciplines are related to movement systems, also in the physio-pathological field. Furthermore, basic knowledge for the approach to emergencies and first aid is provided.
As for class-specific activities, teachings in the physiotherapy area are provided as well as teachings of medical and surgical pathology of physiotherapy interest (neurology, orthopaedics, cardiovascular system diseases, etc.). Furthermore, managerial and public health teachings are provided (prevention, application of Law 626 relating to risks in the healthcare environment), as well as practical knowledge in general imaging diagnostics.
The so-called 'other training activities' aim to deepen and develop specific knowledge in the specialized field of Physiotherapy Science.
The aim is also to enable student to use the most common software dedicated to bibliographic research, as well as to understand and interpret scientific literature, with a view to professional development.
The activities related to professional laboratories of the specific SSD (MED/48) aim at providing the skills for:
-	 the functional physiotherapy assessment of the patient, with particular reference to the independent use of assessment scales, specific tests and other tools suitable for the relative compilation of physiotherapy records
-	the definition and construction of the physiotherapy-rehabilitation program
-	independently practicing activities for the functional re-education of motor, psychomotor and cognitive disabilities using physical, manual, massage and occupational therapies
-	the identification of the most useful aids or environmental adaptations to promote maximum autonomy of the person and his quality of life, proposing the use of prostheses and aids, training in their use and verifying their effectiveness
-	the assessment of the rehabilitation methodology according to the functional recovery objectives. 
In reference to the practical application of all means of physical therapy with the use of electromedical devices, students must be able to recognize any unwanted effects/damage on the person caused by inadequate use or improper application.
Note: The SSD MED/48 is intended for Teachers in possession of the Professional Qualification of Physiotherapist or equivalent qualification.
