Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree course in Mechanical Engineering aims at training professionals eligible to work in public and private research centres, and  to carry out professional activities of high scientific and technical profile, also supporting industrial or university research; particular attention is paid, in line with the cultural vastness of Mechanical Engineering, as it has established itself over the decades, both nationally and internationally,  to its three typical aspects: the design, manufacture and operation of mechanical artifacts .
In detail, the following skills are considered specific training objectives:
- Tackling highly complex problems in the field of mechanical engineering, understanding their phenomenology in depth and knowing how to schematize, model and solve them also through an interdisciplinary approach;
- Correctly applying methodologies and techniques for the design and testing of machines, components and mechanical systems; planning, designing and managing highly complex experiments and tests on machines, components and mechanical systems, critically evaluating the results; using theoretical models and specialist software for solving mechanical engineering problems and to interpret the results competently; seeking innovative technical and design solutions, managing the research and development of products and systems
- broadening and deepening one's own knowledge, skills and abilities for the purpose of effective updating during professional life;
- Effectively communicating in Italian and English, in written and oral form, information, data and solutions to specialists and non-specialists, and dealing with international technical literature;
- Interacting with interdisciplinary working groups, thanks to the knowledge of the various technical-scientific and regulatory tools and languages of the sector and communication methods.
These objectives will be achieved through an articulated training course that will explore various topics, also multidisciplinary ones, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, providing knowledge and skills to develop and manage the various phases of design, production and operation of mechanical components and systems, with respect to:
- project: the problems of the 'design' of mechanical parts of machines and plants, of the mechanical characterization of traditional and innovative materials, of the analysis of tensions and non-intrusive measurements will be addressed;
- production: the problems and optimization of workings and treatments, including thermal ones, of metallic, plastic and composite materials, the organization of industrial production and quality control will be addressed;
- operation: the problems of continuous and non-continuous combustion will be addressed, such as in internal combustion engines, cogeneration and energy saving plants using compressible fluid machines, management of refrigerating plants and of the related volumetric operating machines.
The training methods are diversified, such as to acquiring and strengthening transversal skills (soft skills). In particular, together with traditional lessons and exercises in which the student will participate by independently elaborating the theoretical contents and the application implications, the course includes various laboratory activities, particularly useful for entering the labour market, in which students are given the opportunity to interact directly with professional tools, equipment and software, and teamwork is stimulated through the development and presentation of design solutions based on assigned specifications. Seminars and industrial case studies are also included in various teachings which, through representative testimonies,  introduce students to the problems and dynamics of the productive world.
The presence of teachings (curricular and elective) delivered in English and the use of texts and teaching materials in English will contribute to the acquisition of knowledge of disciplinary terminology and the ability to communicate effectively in English. Experiences abroad will also be encouraged through student mobility programs and thesis preparation abroad. The educational programme is completed by a fairly extensive internship period and the final exam, a wide-ranging dissertation developed independently and in an original way, with a significant personal contribution, which must be presented and discussed in front of a special commission.
An important period, equivalent to 24 credits, is dedicated to a long apprenticeship/internship in companies located both in the territory and in the rest of the country. During this period, student will be able to complete their training by adding professional skills and, at the end, being ready to enter the labour market. The extensive internship period, in fact, enables students to be involved in high-profile corporate training activities, to complete their training in the corporate environment, acquiring specific skills and "soft skills".

Professional opportunities
Profile:
Senior Mechanical Engineer
Functions:
-	design of components and machines, under the construction and functional/energetic perspective.
-	Design of industrial plants, systems, and processes, under the functional, energetic, and economic perspective.
-	Operation of machines, plants, systems, and processes.
-	Research and development activity under the theoretical and experimental perspective.
Skills:
Freelance activity in the design of components and plants.
Production official in production facilities.
The mechanical engineer carries out its functions in companies, public or private bodies or as a freelancer, working both independently and within working groups, often multidisciplinary ones, also taking responsibility for coordination. 
Investigations carried out by the Inter-University Consortium ALMALAUREA in the years 2008 to 2011 indicate that the employment sectors of the holders of a 2nd cycle degree in mechanical engineering are the industry for about 80% and services for the 18%. 
With regard to the industrial sector, 50% of the total number of graduates find employment in the Metalworking and precision engineering industry, 15% in the Chemical / Energy, 8% in the Building industry, 7 % in other manufacturing sectors. 
The natural professional areas for mechanical engineer are: the mechanical and electromechanical industry; the chemical industry, companies and institutions for energy conversion, plant engineering companies, industrial automation and robotics companies, manufacturing firms in general for the production, installation, testing, maintenance and operation of machines, lines and production departments, complex systems. 
Almost all industrial sectors require such professional, therefore they may find professional opportunities in several fields.
