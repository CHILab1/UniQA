Educational objectives
The Degree Course in Aerospace Engineering aims to provide students with solid basic groundings in mathematical, physical and computer science disciplines as well as specific skills related to the disciplinary areas of atmospheric and space flight mechanics, aerodynamics, materials, and aerospace technologies and constructions. These skills contribute to the ability to identify, analyse and interpret typical industrial engineering problems in general and the aerospace sector in particular.
The Course provides strong transversal skills, namely in computer science, with the aim of training professionals capable of using updated tools for the analysis and interpretation of complex systems. Graduates will also acquire the ability to find in the specialized literature, also in English, the information necessary to study new methods for solving typical multidisciplinary aerospace engineering problems. 
The educational programme is divided into the following disciplinary blocks:
- Basic scientific training: mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science.
- Basic engineering training in the industrial field: technical physics, electrical engineering, structural mechanics, CAD, elements of economics, science and technology of materials, mechanical measurements.
- Specific training in aerospace engineering: mechanics of atmospheric and space flight, aerodynamics, aerospace constructions and technologies.
The elective credits enable students to integrate their training with specific contents, among which the following are encouraged (not prescribed): mathematical methods for engineering, complements of mechanics and fundamentals of robotics, elements of electronics, data science and machine learning.
The credits for internships or other activities are related to internships at companies or, alternatively, integrative laboratory training activities.
The training groups are provided with a specific chronological progression of teachings:
- In the first year, most of the basic subjects, English language and elements of aerospace engineering are provided.
- In the second year, the basic training is completed, and the fundamental courses of industrial engineering are provided.
- The third year includes the specific aerospace engineering subJects and elective credits.

Final examination features
To obtain the Degree, undergraduates must have acquired 180 educational credits (CFU) including the credits related to the final examination.
The final examination aims at testing the level of maturity and the critical skills of undergraduates, with respect to learning and acquired knowledge, con completion of the activities envisaged by the educational programme.
It consists of the preparation, also through multimedia software, and discussion of a paper on a topic selected by the student in a list prepared by the Degree course, consistent with the Course educational objectives, in which undergraduates must show their ability to analyse, investigate and critically rework the chosen topic.
