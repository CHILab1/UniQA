Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree in Natural Sciences is mainly characterized by its declared interdisciplinarity.
In fact, it constitutes one of the natural outlets for graduates of class L 32 - Science and Technology for the environment and nature - equally interdisciplinary in its articulation.
The 2nd cycle Degree aims at deepening the knowledge acquired in the 1st cycle course, training graduates with in-depth knowledge of the structural and functional components of ecosystems, both in the current environment and in the past, and to outline the conceptual tools aimed at conservation, defence, and management of the environment.
Adequate knowledge will also be provided for analysing biodiversity at different levels of organization (from genetic to specific and environmental biodiversity) as well as the skills for assessing ecosystems.
To deal with the complexity of the evolution of ecosystems in the various aspects, the degree can be divided into paths (curricula) defined by the Course Regulations.
Among the sectors which may be the subject of in-depth study, we highlight the analysis, management and conservation of natural environments through the acquisition of theoretical principles and modern technologies for environmental analysis; the systemic analysis of the natural environment of the recent past, mainly considered in its evolutionary and anthropological dimension; the study and analysis of continental aquatic ecosystems in order to combine the exploitation of water resources and the protection and conservation of the biological heritage, in compliance with EU directives and the requests of local authorities responsible for land management.
The educational programme will be integrated by laboratory activities, internships and practice, also in public institutions and private facilities, and field experimentation, through multi- and inter-disciplinary trips, among the training activities in the various scientific sectors.
At the end of the Course, graduates will have acquired in-depth knowledge with respect to the study of the biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems, their conservation, land management techniques, and processes influencing the quality of the environment and the conservation of biodiversity .

They will be able to plan, Illustrate and interpret field and laboratory activities, selecting the most appropriate procedures for elaborating, analysing and synthetizing data, for impact evaluation studies (flora, fauna) and assessment; preparation of (biological and a-biological) thematic maps through the use of GIS and databases. They will be able to develop methods and techniques of territorial survey.
Professional opportunities
In the public sector:
Universities and Research agencies.
Environmental management and services, Ministries, local authorities, and other public bodies.
