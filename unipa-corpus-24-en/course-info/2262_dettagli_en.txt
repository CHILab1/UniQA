Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in "International Relations, Politics & Trade" aims at training professional experts in the internationalization processes of companies.
The expert in internationalization processes is responsible for setting up and developing the strategy and activities of the company on the  international markets, whether of a commercial nature (export management, import management, e-commerce), production or distribution, regardless of the product sector, expressed also through a stable presence in the target countries.
The professional profiles are:
- Foreign trade specialist - Specialists in the marketing of goods and services (excluding the ICT sector) (ISTAT category 2.5.1.5.2)
- Specialists in the acquisition of goods and services (ISTAT category 2.5.1.5.1)
- Experts in the study, management, and control of social phenomena (ISTAT category 2.5.3.2.1)
- Specialists in international supply chain management - Specialists in management and control in private companies (ISTAT category 2.5.1.2.0)
- Economic systems specialists - international business strategies expert (ISTAT category 2.5.3.1.1)
- Specialists in international business public relations (ISTAT category 2.5.1.6.0)
Given that full command of the English language is an essential pre-requisite for the role, the professionals operate with decision-making autonomy in the business environment, possessing general knowledge of the dynamics and techniques of international trade, ability to manage in terms of problem solving and planning the activities on foreign markets, as well as the management and control of personnel involved in import, export and production abroad.
The Course aims at providing students with advanced knowledge in the analysis of international, multilevel, and global processes and policies, as well as specialized language skills indispensable for communicating in qualified international work contexts, in addition to access requirements, equal to at least B2 of the English language. In this regard, a teaching of "business English" has been envisaged (L-LIN/12).
International Relations & Trade online wants to provide learners - by combining a broad theoretical perspective with a decidedly practical and experiential cut - cultural tools suitable for operating in the world of international trade, thus promoting the companies’ internationalization processes.
The course will be divided into four main training areas with distinct objectives:
a) The juridical one, addressing the issues of international contract law (IUS/02), the world regulation of trade in the WTO and multilateral agreements (IUS/21), transport law and international logistics (IUS/01 ), as well as customs law (IUS/12) and the protection of intellectual property (IUS/04). The aim is to make learners acquire knowledge of the legal instruments related to international trade and foreign direct investments.
b). The historical one, addressing: the history of international commercial relations (SPS/6 - SPS/13), of processes and international economy (SECS-P/04), and the dynamics and consequences of decolonization on current markets (M-STO/04). The objective is to make the student acquire the ability to identify and select the relevant sources and data for the analysis of global political, legal, and economic processes, in a diachronic perspective.
c) The political science one, dealing with the issue of political risk in international commercial transactions (SPS/04). The objective is to make the student acquire the ability to analyse political and security risks related to investments and international commercial transactions.
d) The economic one, addressing issues related to the design and implementation of corporate strategies, entrepreneurial initiatives and investment policies (SECS-P/07) and to the management of the international distribution chain (ING-IND 35), aimed at supporting companies - especially small and medium size ones - in the development processes at local and international level according to a sustainability perspective, as well as in the evaluation of the organizational results - emerging from the adoption of these strategies - through the analysis of business processes and the use of appropriate performance indicators (effectiveness , efficiency, economy).
In this respect, the aim of this group of courses is to make students acquire theoretical knowledge and application tools aimed at supporting the governance of corporate development and the exploration of the underlying value creation processes through a sustainability approach, i.e. one that balances the perspective strategic in time (short vs long term) and in space (local, regional, national vs international level).
Knowledge of the English language, at least equal to B/2, which is a prerequisite for accessing the course and the vehicular language of all teachings, will be further improved thanks to the inclusion of a specialist English subject, "business English" (L- LIN/12), with the objective of deepening the specialist language and communication techniques in the negotiation field.
An annual workshop, included among other useful knowledge for entering the labour market, will be dedicated to digital export and digital marketing, thus implementing the suggestions of stakeholders.
The educational programme culminates in the elaboration and discussion of an original written thesis carried out under the guidance of a supervisor among the teachers of the course of study, possibly accompanied by an external co-supervisor coming from the bodies in which the student carried out the training internship.
