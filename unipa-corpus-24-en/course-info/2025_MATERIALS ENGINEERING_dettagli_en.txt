Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle degree course aims at providing advanced knowledge in the area of traditional Chemical engineering, as well as advanced competences enabling graduates to interact with other advanced sectors in the field of scientific and technological innovation.
The course will therefore provide for mandatory and elective courses, related to applied kinetics and chemical reactors, safety and process optimization, equipment design, science and technology of materials, which are functional to the acquisition of useful knowledge tools for the design and management of traditional as well as innovative chemical processes. 
Individual courses aim at providing basic knowledge with respect to those sectors which represent the trends in the development of chemical engineering, in close synergy with other disciplines, such as nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, energetics and environment.
Typical industrial engineering subjects, such as Machines and Machine elements  will also be taught, which are in synergy with professional chemical engineering skills, and functional to job placement.
The course also provides other educational activities, with particular emphasis on advanced seminars, both in traditional chemical engineering and in innovative technologies.
The natural completion of such educational programme is an extensive work for the experimental dissertation, awarded with 24 credits.
