Educational objectives
Specific objectives:
The educational programme of the Degree Course in Economics and Finance aims at providing students with an adequate understanding of the functioning of modern economic and financial processes and systems. This acquisition occurs primarily through knowledge of the fundamental principles of the four disciplinary areas of the degrees in Economic Sciences, namely economic theory, business economics, the foundations of public and private law and basic mathematical and statistical disciplines. In this sense, the degree course responds to the primary need to ensure general contents to the preparation of students, enabling them to undertake professional profiles with greater specialization content. The objective is to train economists, able to describe and interpret economic phenomena both at the system level and at the market level with particular attention to understanding the interactions between economics and finance. These professionals will be able to operate at the intermediate management level both in the private and public employment sectors. With reference to the aspect related to the interpretation of phenomena, graduates in Economics and Finance will possess and use, on the one hand, the tools of financial analysis and the techniques connected to modern finance and, on the other, the specific knowledge connected to the problems related to public policies and applied economics, with particular reference to the phenomena related to economic and territorial development. The course offers students the analytical and quantitative tools necessary for modern economic analysis and, at the same time, the indispensable knowledge of the institutional structures affecting and orienting the markets dynamics. In this sense, graduates in Economics and Finance will be able to examine individual decision-making processes and interpret systemic facts also through the forecasting of economic and financial movements at the micro and macro levels.
The structure of the Degree Course includes a large core of common teachings (two in the theoretical disciplines of economics, at least one course more oriented to the normative aspects of economics, historical disciplines of the economic field, general mathematics, at least two courses of statistical content (one of which is basic), private law and public law, English language, computer science, a group of specific teachings aimed at financial analysis (other private legal disciplines, monetary economics, financial mathematics, management of financial intermediaries, corporate finance) and another group of specific teachings aimed at applied economic analysis (in the field of territorial economics, other social sciences, analysis of the business system). The possible differentiations between the training profiles justify the wide range of credits within the class specific activities of the economic and statistical-mathematical fields.
