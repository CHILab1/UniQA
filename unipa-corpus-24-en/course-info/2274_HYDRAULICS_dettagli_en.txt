Educational objectives
Specific objectives:
The 2nd cycle Degree in Civil Engineering, further developing the skills and knowledge acquired in the 1st cycle degree, aims at training highly qualified professionals, capable of tackling even complex problems related to the typical areas of civil engineering: structural, geotechnical, hydraulic, infrastructural and transport.
The specific educational objectives are related to:
- The foundational aspects of the theory of structures and the dynamics of structures. The most professionalizing aspects related to the design of bridges and steel structures will be explored in depth, with reference to the problems connected to design in seismic zones.
- The methods and tools for the design of foundation works, support works, earthworks, tunnels, dams, controlled landfills and interventions for the stabilization of natural slopes. The general issues concerning the mechanics of soils and rocks will be explored in depth.
- Methods and tools for the design of works and systems for the exploitation of water resources and for water defence, delving into management aspects, health-environmental aspects as well as constructions at sea and coastal defence. Ample space will also be dedicated to hydrology.
- Methods and tools for the geometric-functional design of road, railway and airport infrastructures and their safety, for their management and construction, as well as techniques for the design of structural elements included in the road body and for the choice of construction materials.
- Methods and tools for planning, design, management and operation of the transport system, understood as an integrated set of infrastructures, means, production technologies and organizational techniques of mobility services.
- Methods for conducting highly difficult experimental tests and the interpretation of data in various sectors of Civil Engineering.
Furthermore, the course of study provides advanced knowledge of computer-aided design and computational methods which, in recent decades, have contributed to innovate the entire field of engineering and applied sciences.
The first year consists of basic and related subjects as well as class-specific teachings, aiming at strengthening interdisciplinary training. The second year includes the in-depth study of disciplines related to the different areas of Civil Engineering: structures, geotechnics, hydraulics, road infrastructures and transport, to achieve the specific training objectives listed above. The framework is completed by elective teachings (18 or 12 credits depending on the curriculum), other training activities useful for entering the job market (6 or 9 credits depending on the curriculum) and the final exam (9 credits), aiming at assessing the achievement of the students' learning outcomes and their autonomy of judgment and communication skills.

Professional opportunities
Profile:
Civil Engineer for the planning, design, construction and management of civil infrastructures.
Functions:
The 2nd cycle graduate in civil engineering is a technician capable of planning, designing, building and managing the artifacts and infrastructures intended for civil use in the hydraulic, geotechnical, structural and transport infrastructure fields.
With respect to work contexts, graduates in civil engineering can take on technical and/or management roles related to:
1) the evaluation of the feasibility, economic efficiency and functionality of engineering works, such as civil and industrial buildings, hydraulic constructions and network infrastructures (aqueducts, sewer systems, canalizations ...), transport infrastructures, bridges and tunnels, maritime constructions, as well as their impact on the territory.
2) the planning and programming of civil engineering works based on urban-territorial needs.
3) the design of the engineering work from conception to sizing, verification, design of construction details, graphic elaboration of its elements and composition of its whole.
4) the elaboration of feasibility studies for the design of large works (dams, viaducts, tunnels....).
5) the performance of technical management tasks during the construction phase of the work.
6) the coordination of the activities constituting the civil engineering project and the control of the administrative-legislative-economic aspects of the project.
7) the monitoring of the state of the works and of the environmental parameters that may require restoration, functional requalification and/or recovery interventions.
8) the definition and design of standards and procedures to guarantee the functionality and safety of civil structures and infrastructures.
Skills:
Civil engineers, thanks to the educational programme, possess knowledge and analysis skills which are transversal to the specialist topics addressed, with respect to:
- the calculation and design criteria of different structural typologies, even complex ones.
- the safety level of the (new and/or existing) structures and infrastructures, with reference to the modern requirements of the performance-type regulations.
- the principles, methodologies and updated calculation methods for the design of hydraulic works and network infrastructures.
- the principles, methodologies and tools for modelling the behaviour of the ground and its interaction with the structures and artefacts, as well as for the calculation of the main geotechnical works, even complex ones.
- the modelling methodologies of individual and collective transport systems in relation to transport demand.
- the theories and techniques of design, construction, maintenance and management of road infrastructures (road, railway, including underground, airport), in relation to the operation safety, and to the socio-economic impact on the territory and the environment.
- the characteristics of materials, including innovative ones, to be used for the specific structural application.
- the technique of road, railway and airport works, the design and functional analysis of superstructures.
- the design in seismic zones, the interventions for the remediation of landslides, the arrangement and management of hydrographic basins.
- the problems and methodologies of representation of the territory and the techniques of control and monitoring of structures, artifacts and civil infrastructures.
- the conduct of experimental tests, including complex ones, in the various areas of interest of civil engineering.
Career opportunities:
Civil engineers can work in technical and/or managerial positions, with a degree of responsibility appropriate to the level of competence progressively acquired, in the following areas:
- as freelancers, in professional firms and companies for the performance of design and/or consultancy activities aimed at determining forms of technical support for the decision-making process.
- in private companies for the construction and maintenance of civil works.
- in public bodies with technical branches responsible for the planning, design and management of civil works and infrastructures (Owners and Management Companies).
- in companies, bodies, consortia and agencies for the management and control of systems of works and services, with respect, in particular, to civil systems and infrastructures.
- in service companies for the feasibility study of the urban and territorial impact of civil works and infrastructures.
- in public and private research and experimentation centres.

Final examination features
The final exam for the 2nd cycle Degree in Civil Engineering consists of the discussion of an original thesis work, on a topic proposed by the student and approved by the Board of the Degree Course, prepared by the undergraduate under the guidance of one or more supervisors, of which at least one is included among the professors and researchers of the University of Palermo or the holders of teaching in the course of study.
Students can take the final exam after completing all the other activities necessary for the achievement of the 2nd cycle degree.
The thesis work consists of an original activity of design or theoretical or experimental research and constitutes an important opportunity to acquire operational skills, to learn techniques and analysis tools, to develop interpretative schemes and procedures.
The final exam aims at assessing the scientific maturity achieved by the student, the autonomy of judgment and mastery of the topics, the ability to operate autonomously and the communication skills. The discussion also aims at evaluating the general preparation of the student in relation to the educational content of the Degree Course. Part of the preparation of the final exam may take place within an internship or training activity. In this case, part of the credits that should have been allocated to the final exam may be allocated to the internship activities.
The methods of carrying out the final exam are specified in the Degree Course educational Regulations.
