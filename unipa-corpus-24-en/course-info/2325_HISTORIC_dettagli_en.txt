Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree in History, Anthropology and Geography provides specialist knowledge of historical issues related to Europe in the global context, and of the issues related to man-environment relation particularly in the modern and contemporary age. 
The historical curriculum trains students in the methodologies of research and production of historical knowledge, taking into account the acquisitions and revisions of the historiographical tradition, especially in terms of the critical treatment of documentary, narrative and other sources, also in light of the current use of information technology. Specifically investigated areas are those of political history and of economic, institutional, social, cultural and religious history. 
In the anthropological-geographic curriculum, the Course aims at building specialized skills in anthropological and geographic studies, both under the theoretical and methodological perspective, designed to deal critically with geographic information systems and cartographic representations and to elaborate models of reading and interpretation of complex territorial systems, thanks to the use of information and multimedia technologies.
Course outline
The historical curriculum, starting from adequate basic knowledge, is developed through class-specific teaching courses located in two main chronological areas of European history (History of Medieval Europe, M-STO/01, History of Modern Europe, M-STO/02). Class-specific activities enable to set up historiographical, methodological and didactic problems (sources and methods of modern history, M-STO/02), while the reflection on the concepts of interpretation, the close observation of aspects and crucial cruxes of the European affair, with special reference to the Mediterranean area, are entrusted to a range of related disciplines in the M-STO/01 sectors. Medieval history, M-STO/02 Modern history and M-STO/04 Contemporary history . These disciplines focus the study on the specificities of the Mediterranean area (History of the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages, History of the Mediterranean in the Modern Age) or on the problems of sources (Exegesis of medieval sources), on institutional aspects (Institutions of the modern age, History of thought and political institutions SPS/02), on the problems of ecclesiastical history (History of the Churches in the Modern Age). Along these paths, other class-specific subjects provide thematic and disciplinary cuts of different nature and breadth (Cultural Anthropology M-DEA/01, Economic History SECS-P/12, Cultural Geography GGR-01), intended to incorporate historical knowledge into the problematic and methodological context of the human sciences. Furthermore, an important class-specific methodological discipline such as Archiving (M-STO/08) contributes to a rigorous training in the treatment of historical sources, together with the two Laboratories (Other activities) for the applications of digital technologies to historical studies.
6 credits related to training internships allow students to apply the acquired skills, namely the ones useful for a future job placement in the communication, management and enhancement of cultural heritage.
The anthropological-geographic curriculum is based on a large group of disciplines that characterize the two thematic areas (Cultural Anthropology, European Ethnology, Social Anthropology, all of the M-DEA/01 sector, Cultural Geography GGR/01), intended to provide fundamental tools for the study of these areas in their various forms, with reference to the most current issues of multiculturalism and social transformations. Other class-specific subjects, common to the two curricula (Archiving M-STO/08, Sources and methods of modern history M-STO/01) - as well as the aforementioned laboratories â€“ aim at providing skills related to the treatment of sources, while the two class-specific historical subjects (History of Medieval Europe M-STO/01, History of Modern Europe M-STO/02, Economic History SECS-P/12) - analogously to the anthropological and geographical disciplines in the historical curriculum - aim at combining the specific training of the curriculum with in-depth knowledge of the history of Europe.
The related disciplines in the sectors GGR/02 (Urban geography and territorial organization) and M-DEA/01 (Ethno-anthropology and Anthropology of language) are important lines of deepening anthropological and geographical studies in key sectors of the current perspectives of these cultural areas, such as environmental problems, linguistic identities, interculturalism.
