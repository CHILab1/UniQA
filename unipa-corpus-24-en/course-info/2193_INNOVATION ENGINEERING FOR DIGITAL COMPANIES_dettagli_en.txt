Educational objectives
The Degree Course in Digital Enterprise Innovation Engineering aims at training first level engineers with sound basic engineering knowledge and with specialized, digital and economic-managerial skills enabling them to manage production and organizational processes, to design and implement services and products, in public and private companies characterized by a wide use of digital technologies.
Students are given the skills needed to solve technical, IT, economic, managerial, and organizational problems through typical engineering tools, with a general preparation sufficient to acquire and quickly adapt, even independently, their training to the changing needs of the labour market.
The Degree Course offers a flexible educational path combining basic scientific knowledge with technological innovation, to train experts of digital innovation, namely in the areas of management engineering and computer engineering.
The educational project is based on a solid training, involving the acquisition of knowledge and skills concerning the basic disciplines typical of engineering such as calculus, geometry, physics, as well as the foundations of computer science.
Particularly important are the disciplines closely related to the peculiarities of the profession, enabling students to fully understand the regulatory, economic, and managerial aspects of companies, such as digital markets economics and law, quality management and product development. The educational project also gives the opportunity to deeply investigate aspects related to the design and operation of the processes characterising a service supply chain, and to business economics.
Students will acquire solid skills enabling them to identify the best technical and algorithmic solutions to define new processes and products. Specific attention is given to the skills that will enable graduates to bring innovation into companies with strong digital vocation, thanks to the ability to design software systems, to understand the functioning of the internet, and to use the main machine learning technologies. The educational project also gives the opportunity to deepen aspects related to operating systems and databases and to acquire specialist knowledge and skills in the programming of software systems.
