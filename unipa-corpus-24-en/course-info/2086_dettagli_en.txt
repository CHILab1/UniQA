Educational objectives
Graduates of this course should have knowledge in various fields of science and technology aimed at the use and management of existing computer systems, as well as at the design and development of new ones. To this end, graduates must acquire adequate knowledge of the basic areas of computer science as well as of the fundamental aspects and support tools of mathematics. Therefore, in accordance with the guidelines of National (GRIN) and international (ACM) Associations in the field, the course syllabus provides:
- The acquisition of basic knowledge of continuous and discrete physics and mathematics.
- Knowledge of the principles, theoretical models and architectures of computer systems and communication networks.
- Knowledge and use of operating systems.
- The acquisition of elements of design and analysis of algorithms and data structures.
- The acquisition of modern programming methodologies as well as the knowledge of programming languages representative of the main programming paradigms.
- Assimilation of the principles and systems for the design and management of databases and related technologies;
- The acquisition of the techniques for the design and implementation of computer systems.
- The acquisition of methods and techniques for the analysis and computer processing of experimental data.
The course also includes:
- The acquisition of interdisciplinary knowledge in related fields.
- An appropriate number of credits reserved for lab courses as well as the laboratory exercises provided in other courses.
- An appropriate number of credits for elective courses in order to better enable students to complete their preparation targeting it to specific interests, in consideration of the pervasiveness of information science and technology in the modern information society.
- external activities such as internships in companies, public administration and laboratories , as well as periods of study at other Italian and foreign universities, also within international agreements.
The educational programme, over the three years, is divided as follows:
1. In the first year, in addition to basic mathematics and physics training, the course provides the scientific foundations of computer science, the first teachings related to programming and data structures, and the basics of architectures and operating systems needed to face the following years.
2. In the second year the mathematical-physical training necessary for the professional computer scientists is completed, as well as the training on the  key aspects of computer science, through the teachings related to data bases, algorithms, theoretic computer science, operating systems, and programming languages.
3. In the third year, students' preparation on algorithmic aspects, digital data processing and compilers is further consolidated. The third year is also dedicated to the acquisition of specific and professionalizing IT knowledge both through teachings in the field of network management and software engineering, and to internship or apprenticeship activities, enabling students to gain experience in the world of work.
