Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in Chemistry aims at training graduates with solid basic groundings enabling them to deal, with competence and autonomy, with professional as well as academic and industrial research activities. With the objective of ensuring advanced chemical competences and a rapid and flexible entrance in the labour market, the course has identified specific educational objectives in the most interesting sectors of chemical sciences to date: chemistry of materials, with respect to soft condensed matter as well as to hard condensed matter; chemistry of environment and cultural heritage; biochemistry and supra-molecular chemistry, chemistry teaching methodology.
A first group of mandatory teachings has therefore been designed to complete scientific competences in the core chemical subjects (Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry and Environment Chemistry) and to introduce more advanced competences. A second group of teachings aims at specialising students through advanced specific courses. Students must therefore choose their personal curriculum choosing among various advanced courses. 
Given the cultural and social importance of teaching scientific subjects in high schools, the 2nd cycle Degree Course in Chemistry provides, starting with academic tear 2018/2019, two teachings (6 credits each) enabling students to consciously face the issues related to historical, epistemological and methodological reflection.
Access to the labour market is also favoured by a cycle of seminars, (2 credits), aiming at presenting students with an overview of the relevant job opportunities. 
The individual cultural and professional interest find their natural outcome in the preparation of degree dissertation, which is also the application of the acquired competences to a specific issue and in an educational internship in public and private companies and agencies.

Final examination features
The final examination consists of an experimental dissertation, written under the guidance of a supervisor, about an original topic related to chemistry. The dissertation work should be carried out in a university research laboratory or in the premises of a public or private agency accredited with the University. During the preparation of the degree dissertation students will tackle the issues of experimental research in Chemistry and use autonomously advanced equipment and methodologies.
