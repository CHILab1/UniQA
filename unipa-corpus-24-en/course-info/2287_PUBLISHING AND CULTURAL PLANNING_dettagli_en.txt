Educational objectives
Communication Sciences is a highly interdisciplinary degree course, providing the theoretical foundations, methodological tools and technical knowledge to understand the complex world of contemporary communication and act within it. The various curricula reflect the professional fields for which the Degree trains and are chosen after a common first year in which the necessary foundations are provided to learn to perceive the complexity of communication phenomena and to understand the different theoretical and methodological dimensions necessary for studying them and operating within them.
It is precisely the complexity of contemporary communication - and the related cultural, social, political, and economic repercussions â€“ to make necessary, from the second year, to focus more on a specific area that becomes the object of specific paths.
Each of these paths offers the opportunity to explore the functioning of specific media, of different types of communication artifacts, of the languages they use, of the variables and strategies that can be used to obtain specific results, of the techniques for measuring the effectiveness of different types of communication.
The educational path is characterized not only by the specialization of the curricula, but also by: 
i)	a considerable attention to professionalizing skills achieved through laboratory teaching, 
ii)	by the high possibility of personalizing the study path
iii)	by the contact with the world of professions.
Each curriculum includes laboratories in which professional technical-practical skills are provided that can be immediately used in the labour market. Each student will be able to choose from a range of options built to cover different types of communication products (from verbal texts to photographs, from websites to visual design) according to the type of profession he/she intends to train for.
The personalization of the educational path is achieved by providing different credits for optional activities, as well as for elective activities, which can be chosen from a wide range of optional courses enabling students to further focus their areas of interest.
Finally, the contact with the world of the professions is achieved through meetings and seminars, providing credits.
The ideal outlet for the Degree Course are the 2nd cycle Degree Courses in Communication, where it is possible to obtain a higher level of understanding and knowledge of communication phenomena, greater mastery of theoretical and methodological tools, and the ability to produce communicative artefacts using additional languages.
