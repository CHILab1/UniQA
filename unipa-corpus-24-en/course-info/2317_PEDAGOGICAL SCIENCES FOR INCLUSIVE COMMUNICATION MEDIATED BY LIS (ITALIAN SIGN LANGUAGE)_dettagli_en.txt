Educational objectives
The Degree Course is characterized by being delivered through the integration of the expertise of the three universities involved, which will divide the study disciplines in a balanced way. From an organizational point of view, a mixed modality was chosen, which allows the use of the training activities by the students of the three locations of the course, pursuing the following objectives:
(1) maximize the activities in presence in each location;
(2) guarantee in each location the interaction in presence between enrolled students;
(3) favor the teaching activities in laboratory or active form, also according to the Problem Based Learning model (PBL - Teaching methodology adopted in many European universities and in particular in the University of Maastricht).
In order to pursue these goals, the following organizational and training choices will be made:
- on an experimental basis and given the active and participatory teaching approach, a maximum number of 116 students is expected, identified through a selective procedure, distributed in 38 per location, according to the order of preference indicated by the candidates at the time of participation in the call. The selective procedure and the students' careers will be managed by the University of Palermo as the administrative headquarters, as established by the Agreement stipulated between the three Universities involved. Student services will be provided in each of the three locations
- The teachers involved come in the amount of 1/3 (approximately) from each of the three locations, so that each cohort of students can benefit from in-person contact with the teacher.
- In each location, students carry out 1/3 of the lessons in person and the remaining 2/3 remotely.
- Distance learning activities are carried out in university classrooms, simultaneously for both in-person and distance learning students, so that everyone can have a cohesive and collaborative classroom experience. The presence of classroom tutors who are facilitators and group mediators allows for the coordination of communications between locations (e.g., questions from online classrooms to the in-person classroom) and, above all, the exercise/laboratory and PBL activities.
- For the purposes of developing the problems posed according to the PBL methodology, the subject teacher can also act as a tutor-coordinator
- A technological tutor will be present in each classroom to ensure the correct conduct of distance learning lessons. The technological tutor can also have classroom tutor skills and therefore also perform this role-
- Laboratory teaching methodologies are adopted, carried out in person and with the supervision of specially trained tutors in each of the three locations, also according to the PBL model. The tutors, as is the case at the University of Maastricht, may be, in addition to the subject teacher, also PhD students or LM students who are interested in doing teaching practice or conducting research in this area.
- The credits relating to the acquisition of LIS at the level of practical exercises will be provided entirely in person, in each of the locations. For this purpose, deaf teachers who sign are provided with the function of CEL Expert Linguistic Collaborators who will take care of the LIS exercises in each of the three locations.
The administrative headquarters is identified at the University of Palermo.
The educational offer of the Degree Course may be integrated/varied with flexible programming and teaching based on student assessments and periodic consultations with stakeholders. The AQ Commission and the Degree Course Coordinator will take into account their indications, adapting it to the needs expressed by the students and also to the new demands of the job market.
The chosen organizational method allows to make the best use of the expertise of the three university locations and will guarantee students a high level of quality of the teachings provided. Finally, to encourage the enrollment of deaf students, the CdS will, in collaboration with the ENS and other deaf associations, advertise the Course throughout the country.
In fact, it provides theoretical knowledge and adequate operational skills to carry out the activity of pedagogist, with functions of planning, pedagogical coordination, training of educators and promoter of change and development within different educational, training and social contexts.
In this perspective, it aims to develop adequate knowledge and skills:
in the observational field, in planning and evaluation;
in the theories, strategies and systems of education;
in the methodologies of educational research;
in the group dimension, in networking and supervision;
in the processes of continuous training
At the same time, it also provides specific knowledge and skills to carry out the role of Pedagogist, expert in inclusive communication processes.
In this perspective, the Degree Course intends to provide students with adequate knowledge and skills in relation to:
- Italian Sign Language (LIS) and the specific vocabulary of the various disciplines;
- the history and culture of the deaf in Italy;
- linguistics for deafness;
- developmental and learning psychology;
- the relationship between cognition, deafness and learning and the relationship between mind, body and language;
- the functioning of the ear, the etiology and types of deafness, the listening aids available today (cochlear implants and hearing aids); the characteristics of lip-reading;
- special pedagogy;
- special teaching;
- planning and evaluation;
- communication and mediation strategies and techniques;
- the relational dimension;
- the functioning of educational and training institutions and the legislation relating to them;
- the code of ethical conduct in work at school or in other educational and training contexts.
In a collegial and network perspective, the Pedagogist, expert in inclusive communication processes, will also develop the ability to work professionally alongside the support teacher, curricular teachers and other professional figures such as the Educational Operator for autonomy and communication, Cultural Educational Assistant; as well as the ability to actively collaborate in the drafting of the Dynamic-Functional Profile (PDF) and the Individualized Educational Plan (PEI).
The Pedagogist, expert in inclusive communication processes may find employment at schools of all levels, at educational and professional training centres, within universities as a tutor for students, in network projects with families.
The professionalism provided by the Degree Course will allow the expert pedagogist to carry out the following tasks:
- developing effective teaching strategies with the curricular teachers and the support teacher to promote learning, autonomy and inclusion of deaf students.
- making the different subjects intelligible to deaf students with their specific vocabulary, facilitating access to the contents without simplifying them.
- playing a mediation role with the families of deaf students, coordinating their intervention with other professional figures (curricular and support teachers, ASL operators, audiologists, speech therapists, etc.).
- activating mediation strategies in terms of communication and relationships between deaf students and their classmates and/or their teachers.
- carrying out a mediation action together with the teachers between the family of the deaf student and the school and supporting relationships with extra-school at large.
- facilitating learning through the use of LIS and/or in a communication mode as suitable as possible to the needs of deaf students based on their communication habits and preferences (lip repetition, writing, visual, multimedia, expressive techniques, etc.)
- playing a consultancy and coordination role for school networks and in the territory.
