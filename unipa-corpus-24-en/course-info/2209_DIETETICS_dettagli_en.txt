Educational objectives
Graduates in Dietistics are, pursuant to law  no. 251, Article 3, paragraph 1 of August, 10, 2000, health professionals in the technical area carrying out, with professional autonomy, activities aimed at the prevention, care and safeguard of individual and collective health, applying the technical procedures needed for the implementation of diagnostic methods on biological materials or on the individual, or technical-assistance activities, in accordance with the provisions concerning the identification of the figures and the relevant professional profiles defined by the decree of the Minister of Health. Graduates in Dietistics have adequate competences in basic disciplines, enabling them to better understand the most important elements that underpin the evolutionary, adult and geriatric age pathologies, upon which they carry out their nutritional technical intervention. They must also be able to use at least one language of the European Union, besides Italian, in the specific area of competence and for exchanging general information. Within the profession of Dietician, graduates are healthcare professionals carrying out the duties assigned by the Decree of the Ministry of Health of 14 September 1994, no. 744, and subsequent modifications and additions; they are competent for all activities aiming at the proper application of nutrition, including the educational aspects and the collaboration in the implementation of food policies, in compliance with current legislation.
In particular, graduates in Dietistics, depending on their training paths, must reach the professional competence below described and specified. The achievement of professional skills is obtained through theoretical and practical training, also including the acquisition of behavioural skills and is achieved in the specific context of the profile so as to guarantee, at the end of the training course, full command of all the necessary skills and their immediate usability in the work environment. Particularly important, as an integral and qualifying part of vocational training, is the practical training and apprenticeship activity, carried out with the supervision and guidance of specially assigned professional tutors, coordinated by a teacher belonging to the highest professional training level and corresponding to the standards defined at European level, if existing.
Educational programme
The training course is organized in six semesters and provides theoretical-practical teachings through lectures, exercises, educational workshops and seminars related to basic and clinical subjects; In particular, vocational training in the specific professional sector (MED/49) in the clinical field (nutritional activity for patient groups, inpatients, ambulatory discharge, specialist activity for pathologies, hospital hygiene and catering activities, assessment of body composition, measurement of energy expenditure), in the territory (maternal-infant care, home-based nutrition, etc.), in collective catering for school meals, rest homes, etc.
Appropriate coordination actions during the course year (horizontal co-ordination) and across the different years of the course (vertical coordination) will be implemented, enabling the discussion and critical interaction about the project with the teachers of the various subjects. The course educational regulations define, in compliance with the regulatory limitations, the share of the total hours of study available to the student for personal study or other individual training activities.
In general, frontal teachings provide knowledge to address traineeship experiences. Core subjects are concentrated in the first year of the course and ensure the acquisition of the cognitive tools needed to develop the training programme that will continue in the following years through class-specific subjects. The latter, mostly present in the second and third course year, aim at providing the cultural elements to understand the various clinical areas in which nutritional intervention is carried out. Class-specific subjects are also aimed at the understanding and organization of dietary treatment and prevention through nutritional intervention, including the description and understanding of social and relational dynamics - with the patient as well as among the various professionals - contributing to the well-being of individual patients or specific population groups.
The latter will be the prevailing goal of the third year of the course. Related disciplines provide knowledge enriching the training on nutrition issues or on other issues necessary for professional work in the healthcare sector.
Mandatory professional internship is a qualifying element of the educational offer, because it allows students to deepen specific and professional skills, with responsibility and autonomy, in a different context than the classroom exercises.
Educational objectives and professional training aim at achieving the highest quality through a continuous evolution of the training standard of students as future professionals. The internship will be evaluated through the following tools:
-	Evaluation forms, examining the general, behavioural and professional aspects in relation to the objectives, completed by the tutor and shared by the student;
-	The training record as another reference to better understand the experience.
Agreements with healthcare companies and collective catering companies guarantee an internship as adequate as possible to all real working facilities.
At the end of the three-year period, graduates in Dietistics will acquire the knowledge and technical skills enabling them to fit in in companies and institutions of the clinical area, the food industry and collective catering. Graduates will also acquire the learning skills necessary to undertake specialist studies.
