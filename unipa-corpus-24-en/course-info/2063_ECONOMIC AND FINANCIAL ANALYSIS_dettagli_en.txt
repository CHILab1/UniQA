Educational objectives
The educational programme of the 2nd cycle Degree Course in Economics and Finance aims at providing students with an advanced knowledge of economic and financial disciplines, completing and refining the knowledge acquired in the curricular courses of class 33 and raising the quality standards to levels close to those achievable in other European Union countries.
This objective is achieved through the advanced study, during the first course year, of economic analysis and policy, of the business sciences most connected to economic science, with the addition of advanced legal disciplines and mathematical-statistical disciplines and further knowledge of the English language. The course may subsequently be articulated with specific teachings dedicated to economic and financial analysis and the evaluation of public policies. Further classes are related to the study of the regional economic context. The specific economic-financial paths focus more on the quantitative aspects related to the finance sector (both in the statistical and mathematical field), on at least two specialized economic subjects, investigating the functioning of financial markets, on further disciplines of a historical or quantitative kind, related to the functioning of the banking and credit sector. The specific paths with a public and territorial orientation favour further economic teachings in the field of applied economics and economic policy, as well as teachings of a statistical nature in the public-territorial field and business-oriented teachings in the sector of administration and management of public entities and services. 
The educational program that favours the use of quantitative methods applied to economic research in a multidisciplinary context.
