Educational objectives
The specific objective of the 1st cycle Degree Course in  Electronic Engineering is training  professionals with solid scientific and technological groundings and specific competences in electronics, answering to the needs for soft skills, more and more requested  in smart cities, in the internet-of-things, big data, secure and broadband telecommunications networks, new generation electric networks, as well as in intelligent systems capable of operating without human control (automatic control, domotics, mechatronics, robotics, dynamic systems identification and filtering, but also in diagnostic medicine and in the new production technologies of modern plant engineering).
In addition to the essential tools of core scientific disciplines, the Degree course provides specific teachings in electronics and laboratory experimental activities enabling students to complete their training with subjects related to other areas, such as automation, robotics, electrical engineering, and bioelectronics.
The Degree Course is designed with reference to specific learning areas.
During the first year, students will gain the ability to understand the basic mathematical tools and the fundamentals of physics and, at the same time, they will face specific topics of Information Engineering, such as internet networks, information technology and logical networks.
The second and third course year will be mostly dedicated to specific electronic subjects, which will guide students in the process of learning the methods characterizing the analysis and design of modern electronic devices and systems. The preparation of students will be completed by laboratory experimental activities and by teachings related automation and electrical engineering.
The third course year provides teaching in English language.
During the third year, students can choose:
- to learn the modern techniques of automatic electronic circuit design and the methods for characterization, measurement and testing through electronic equipment (specialization in Modern Electronics).
- to know the tools and methodologies characterizing the Internet of Things and attend the network and telecommunications laboratory (specialization in Internet Technologies).
- to acquire specific skills in the field of sensors and diagnostic equipment, as well as in the processing and analysis of signals, images and medical-biological data (specialization in Biomedical Information Technologies).
- to acquire the typical knowledge of the Control and Systems Engineering, industrial and mobile robotics and mechatronics as well as of the management of complex systems (specialisation in Electronics for Robotics and Mechatronics) 
Thanks to the solid technical and scientific bases provided, the Degree Course in Electronic Engineering can guarantee a profitable access to the labour market right at the end of the studies, but also enables graduates to deepen their own competences by enrolling in a 2nd cycle Degree Course.
