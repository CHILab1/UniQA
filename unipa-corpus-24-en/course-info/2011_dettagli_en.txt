Educational objectives
2nd  cycle graduates in Medical Biotechnologies and Molecular Medicine should possess basic knowledge of congenital or acquired medical and surgical human pathologies, where they may intervene with a biotechnological approach, both in diagnosis and in therapy. 
Graduates must know and be able to apply:  the typical methodologies of cellular, molecular and gene-transfer biotechnologies, for the identification and validation of therapeutical targets as well as innovative diagnostic solutions for molecular medicine, oncology, regenerative medicine and biocompatibility; the innovative technologies of genetic engineering for genic therapies; the technologies for the therapies with stem cells; the applied technologies for the study of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics; the techniques envisaging the use of biomaterials and nanotechnologies applied to medicine; the human assisted reproduction techniques. 
Graduates will acquire: familiarity with the principles of experimental design upon biological systems; command of the methods to access biotechnological databases in the biomedical field; ability to produce experimental in vitro and in vivo models for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutical approaches. Graduates should also be able to design and apply, together with graduates in Medicine and Surgery, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the specific areas of competence.
The Degree Course is divided into four semesters and it is articulated in frontal lectures, seminars, laboratory practice and internships, providing the professional training of medical biotechnologists; in the preparation of an experimental dissertation, with the student attending a highly qualified and specialised laboratory; in international laboratory experiences, thanks to Erasmus mobility; in internships at biotechnological companies. The course programs also provides, through integrative non-frontal teaching activities, the development of the following soft skills: a) problem solving; a) formulation of autonomous judgments; c) ability to work in a group; d) organising and planning activity; e) ability to communicate effectively; f) ability to acquire new knowledge and to analyse and synthesise information; g) ability to design research plans and to critically evaluate scientific works.
The course as a whole aims at providing students qualified practical training and the acquisition of soft skills, to educate graduates with advanced skills, adequate to fit in the labour market.

Final examination features
The final paper should be original and experimental. The final examination consists in the discussion of a dissertation of original results obtained by the students while attending a laboratory for a minimum period of 7 months and related to an experimental activity in the field of medical Biotechnologies and Molecular Medicine. The final paper, or part of it, might also be prepared at other Italian or foreign, public or private institutions and companies, accredited by the University of Palermo.
