Educational objectives
Specific objectives:
The Degree Course in Agricultural Sciences and Technologies (STA) provides knowledge in the agricultural field with particular reference to the technologies and management of agricultural (vegetable and animal) production in their quantitative-qualitative and hygienic-sanitary aspects, to the transformation and marketing of agricultural products, to the technical-economic management of the agricultural enterprise, to the application of policies for rural development, to the evaluation of land assets.
Graduates in STA acquire basic knowledge in the fields of the preparatory subjects (mathematics, chemistry, plant and animal biology and agricultural genetics) and of the professional ones. This knowledge allows the achievement of a professional training including the principles of agronomy, agri-ecology and the defence of cultivated species, as well as those relating to livestock farming. During their training, undergraduates acquire knowledge of the techniques for detecting biological (animal and vegetal) and environmental parameters useful for subsequent qualitative and quantitative processing, to understand the production processes, the transformation of agricultural products and the conservation of the rural environment. Likewise, they acquire the principles of hydraulics, agricultural mechanics and agricultural economics, knowledge of rural development and market policies, tools for the evaluation of land assets, for the design and evaluation of cultivation systems and for the technical-economic management of conventional and organic agricultural companies and processing companies, which are also essential for carrying out the professional activity.
The profile requires the dialectical ability necessary to disseminate and argue the technical choices with sector specialists, entrepreneurs and consumers, and a sufficient command of the English language (or another EU language) necessary for reading and interpreting technical-scientific texts, for professional exchanges and basic dissemination.
The acquired knowledge and skills enable graduates to address and resolve, within the scope of the skills required for the Junior Agronomist, issues relating to:
- cultivation techniques for plant species (trees, herbaceous, horticultural and floricultural) and management of conventional and organic livestock systems.
- agricultural mechanics and mechanization of crops and livestock farms.
- hydraulic-agricultural system interventions and design of irrigation and drainage systems.
- transformation and conservation of plant and livestock products.
- protection of the environment and crops from abiotic and biotic adversities.
- sustainable management, protection and enhancement of agricultural and environmental heritage.
- economics of the agricultural company, agro-environmental policy and the evaluation of land assets.
Furthermore, the first level training guarantees a platform of knowledge adequate for understanding the topics proposed in the next level.
The teaching activity is carried out through lectures, field exercises and laboratory.
The educational programme consists of 19 mandatory exams and elective courses, in addition to the English language test, laboratories (including one of technical English for agriculture), the practical-applicative internship at affiliated facilities and the final oral exam with the aim of ascertaining the level achieved by the student in basic and specific knowledge and in the ability to integrate them. 
The elective credits can be acquired, in accordance with art.10, paragraph 5, letter a) of the Ministerial Decree 270/04, also by choosing teachings in other Degree Courses of the University of Palermo and other Italian and foreign universities.
At the end of the degree course, students obtain the title of Doctor of Agricultural Sciences and Technologies and, after passing the national exam for professional qualification, can be registered in section B (Junior Agronomist) of the professional register of the Board of Agronomists and Forestry Doctors.
