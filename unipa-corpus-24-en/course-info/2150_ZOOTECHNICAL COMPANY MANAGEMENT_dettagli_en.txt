The Degree Course primarily pursues the training of professional figures capable of activating business and supply chain initiatives related to the enhancement of agri-food productions with specific, typical, biological, historical, etc. quality traits. The current international economic system and the evolution of food culture, in fact, progressively orient business activity towards the exaltation of the ability to relate to the socio-economic system through forms of integration and coordination of production and organizational activities, with a view to enhancing the specific traits of agri-food products and raising the quality level and food safety.
The educational programme includes class-specific teachings providing skills in the fields of: enhancement and post-harvest treatment of agricultural products, plants and processes for agro-industrial transformation, defence and prevention of foodstuffs from pathogens and possible contamination. Where possible, the teachings are designed based on interdisciplinarity and oriented towards the integration of different skills.
Other class-specific activities also include the economic aspects of the company, the market, agri-food policy at an international level and the specific aspects of the economy of quality and certification. A better understanding of the issues of logistics, packaging technology (packaging and labelling), consumer behaviour and quality perception is pursued through integrative disciplines specifically included in the educational path.
The Degree Course includes the following additional educational activities:
- Elective activities: the relevant credits can be acquired, in accordance with art.10, paragraph 5, letter a) of the Ministerial Decree 270/04 and with the Educational Regulations of the Degree Course and of the University of Palermo, among all the subjects taught at the University if they are consistent with the educational objectives.

- Activities related to the final examination: the final exam consists in the preparation of an original paper to be discussed publicly with a commission, as provided for by the Degree Exam Regulations of the Course.
