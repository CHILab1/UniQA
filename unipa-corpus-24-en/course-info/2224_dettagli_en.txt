Educational objectives
The Degree Course aims at training engineers possessing the basic knowledge and skills of an electrical engineer and being able to know how to apply and decline such knowledge and skills in a new application sector, namely that of electric mobility.
Starting with a solid basic multidisciplinary training, the course provides general groundings in the fields of electrical engineering, electrical machinery and drives, power electronics, electrical systems, electrical measurements, and electromechanical applications, together with more specific competences with respect to the electrical aspects of mobility.
Graduates in Electrical Engineering for E-Mobility will be able to design, build, manage and test all the electrical parts of the vehicle (batteries, converters, motors, wiring and measuring instrumentation) and to design, implement, manage, and test the electricity infrastructures supporting E-Mobility (distribution networks, distributed generation, smart-grid, charging infrastructures).
These objectives are achieved through an educational programme consisting of lectures, exercises, discussion of case studies, seminars and practical applications in the laboratory and in the field.
The course consists of:
• basic subjects (mathematics, physics, geometry, chemistry).
• transversal engineering disciplines typical of Industrial Engineering (computer aided design, construction theory, technical physics).
• basic subjects typical of the degree courses in Electrical Engineering (electrical engineering, electrical machines, electrical systems, and electrical measurements).
• support subjects (electronics, power electronics, principles of design and construction of electric vehicles).
• application subjects (electric drives for the automotive industry, storage systems, sustainable mobility, automotive equipment).
• elective courses that may be chosen among those provided by other Degree Courses to integrate their training independently, according to their interests and attitudes.
