Educational objectives
The degree course in Primary Education, organized into a single trail without specific curricula, promotes an advanced theoretical and practical training in the field of educational psychology, methodological-didactic, technological and disciplines research that characterize the professional profile a kindergarten and primary school teacher. The course also aims at developing a theoretical and teaching-methodological training on the subject areas covered by the teachings laid down by the Ministry of Education National Guidelines for the types of schools considered. It also offers specific training for the reception and integration of students with disabilities.
The five-year degree course in one cycle aims at promoting the development of polyvalent teachers, who know how to integrate creativity, flexibility and attention to motivate to knowledge, typical of kindergarten, with the disciplinary competence characterizing the primary school. It also aims to encourage better continuity between the two types of school, thanks to the presence of competent professionals in both areas.
Teachers trained in the single-cycle degree program will also be competent with respect to the acceptance of students with disabilities, in order to be better able to accept and integrate diversity, highlighting the elements of personalization and establish better collaboration between the classroom teacher and the support teacher. Teachers should be prepared to identify and deal effectively with difficulties and learning disabilities with targeted interventions based on current psycho - pedagogical research. Class teachers will also be able to enhance and positively integrate the differences, which are increasingly evident also for the frequent inter-cultural composition of the class.
The training includes the disciplinary study and the most effective teaching strategies in fostering a genuine learning and development of the motivation of pupils.
Vocational training is related to the management of both the cognitive and the affective and socio-relational aspects of learning, so that the teacher can contribute to the overall formation of the child in a positive classroom climate for the promotion of individual and collective wellbeing.
The course is divided into basic training activities for the acquisition of psycho-pedagogical and teaching-methodological skills, in class specific activities and other activities (training in schools, English language, technology). The curriculum includes two areas of core courses: an area dedicated to the deepening of the content that will be the subject of teaching in the two educational levels considered ("school competences") and a second area with teachings for the reception of disabled students.
The course is divided into courses and workshops, the latter enable students to apply the knowledge acquired in the courses, for example, developing educational materials, designing tools, developing the reflective, critical and collaborative skills through group work and discussions.
