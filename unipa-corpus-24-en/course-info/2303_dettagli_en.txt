Educational objectives
The educational objectives of the Degree in Environmental Engineering for Sustainable Development aim at the knowledge and solution of all design and planning problems relating to the environment and the territory.
Graduates in Environmental Engineering must be able to:
a) analyse and interpret environmental data;
b) use techniques and tools for the design of components, systems and processes aiming at the protection of the environment and the defence of soil;
c) identify the areas at (chemical, industrial, geological) risk in the region with respect to the defence against natural events and human activities;
d) assess the environmental compatibility of projects, also in terms of sustainability, in relation to laws in force; participate in the preparation and management of urban, territorial, and environmental plans and of plans for the utilization and fruition of reserves and nature parks.
The Degree Course provides in-depth study of the issues related to the knowledge of the territory (monitoring, protection and control techniques) as well as to the pollution of the environmental compartments (monitoring, prevention, rehabilitation).
This in-depth study follows the study of basic subjects and more course-specific subjects provided in the first two years of the course. In the first year, students acquire basic knowledge in core disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry, English language, computer science, and applied ecology. During the second year the course provides the knowledge related to the class-specific subjects, such as Hydraulics, Environmental Technical Physics, Cartography, and Environmental Remote Sensing. Finally, the third year focuses on Environmental Health Engineering, Construction Theory, Geotechnical Engineering, and on the Hydrology and Climatology issues ahich are deemed fundamental for the training of an environmental engineer in a climate change context. The third year also provides other educational activities as per art. 10, paragraph 5 letter d of DM 270.
