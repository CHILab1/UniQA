Through the training project, the course aims to provide graduates with the cognitive, methodological and operational tools typical of the professionals in social, organizations and human resources psychology. Psychological knowledge and skills will be provided with respect to the cognitive, affective, and behavioural aspects involved in social processes and in the dynamics activated within social organizations.
Graduates  of this 2nd cycle degree course must acquire advanced preparation in several theoretical, planning and operational fields of social psychology and work and organizational psychology and will be able to perform with high responsibility in organizations and services aimed at individuals, groups, communities (school, health, public administration, companies).
Specifically, graduates will be able to carry out psychosocial actions in full professional autonomy aimed at planning and managing the following activities:

The 2nd cycle degree course in Social, Work and Organizational Psychology gives access to second-level Masters, to specialization schools in the psychology area and to research doctorates. The course lasts two years and provides for the acquisition of 120 university credits (CFU), of which 86 credits dedicated to teachings. The course is completed by an English language knowledge laboratory (level B2), 20 CFU of Practical Evaluation Internship (TPV) and activities related to the final exam. In line with the Interministerial (implementing) Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022 of Law no. 163, 20 credits are acquired by carrying out a practical-evaluative internship (TPV). The TPV takes the form of contextualized and supervised practical activities, involving direct observation, the execution of activities aimed at situated learning, and the development of the procedural and relational skills and abilities fundamental for the exercise of the professional activity. These skills refer to the typical and reserved acts, characterizing the profession of psychologist also pursuant to article 1 of the law of 18 February 1989, n. 56, and include the use of cognitive and intervention tools for prevention, diagnosis, habilitation-rehabilitation activities, psychological support aimed at individuals, groups, social organisms, and communities, as well as experimentation, research and teaching.
The educational path is designed to enable students, during the two-year, to acquire solid skills in the aspects indicated above. Therefore, the specific training objectives previously indicated are reflected in the training activities foreseen in the course.
The educational activities of the first year are related to: the study of the psychology of attitudes and its applications (for example, consumer behaviour and economic behaviour), the understanding of decision-making processes and, more generally, the study of the psychosocial phenomena typical of communities and of organizational contexts. Further educational activities are related to the study of the methodological traits of psychosocial research and interventions. An elective course of 6 credits is also provided, as well as, an English language laboratory (level B2) and 3 CFU of internal Practical Evaluation Internship (TPV) activities, coordinated by the teachers as well as by representatives of the social partners, which provide for direct observation and situated learning of fundamental skills for the profession.
The activities of the second year include the study of measurement techniques in the psychosocial field, of the evaluation techniques of human resources, and of the tools used in the specific area of occupational psychology. The topics related to the area of political psychology complete the activities of the two-year period.
The external Practical Evaluation Internship of 17 credits to be carried out in selected and qualified external structures provides knowledge relating to interventions in the social and organizational reality and professional skills under the supervision of psychologist tutors.
Finally, 10 credits are foreseen for the realization of the final exam.
All TPV teachings and activities include exercises and laboratory activities to allow students to apply their knowledge and understanding skills in the various professional fields to which the degree refers.
