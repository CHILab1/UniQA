Educational objectives
Specific objectives:
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in "Agricultural Production and Technology " is an in-depth study for graduates who intend to consolidate and expand their professional and scientific training in the sector of agricultural production and technologies. The Degree Course aims at improving the technical and scientific skills useful for the design, management and control of agricultural production systems, with connotations of sustainability and multifunctionality; at consolidating professional skills in the management and valorisation of quality products and processes; at providing in-depth knowledge of community policies, the market and the economic evaluation of investments; at expanding skills in the field of design and management of parks and gardens and technical, sports and recreational greenery in urban and extra-urban environments.
During the first year, students will acquire specific professional training in the following sectors:
- propagation, production, management of plant species, shrubs, fruit trees, flowers, industrial herbaceous and medicinal plants. 
- nursery and agronomic management of floricultural, herbaceous, ornamental tree species and their interaction with the urban ecosystem.
- activation of business and supply chain initiatives related to the enhancement of production as well as to the ability to relate to the socioeconomic system.
The second-year contents include teachings related to:
- horticultural crops, integrated control of arthropods.
- landscape analysis, planning and economic evaluation of investments, creation and management of parks, gardens and public and private greenery in general, in urban and extra-urban areas.
The training of students is completed by a series of teachings aimed at acquiring skills in the fields of genetic improvement, irrigation and drainage, machinery and systems for agriculture and maintenance of greenery, integrated control of plant diseases, taxonomy of plant species and design of rural architecture.
The Degree Course includes the following additional training activities:
- Elective activities, in accordance with art. 10, paragraph 5, letter a) of Ministerial Decree 270/04 and with the Teaching Regulations of the Degree Course and the University of Palermo, selected among all the teachings provided University, if consistent with the training objectives.

- Activities related to the final exam, consisting in the drafting of an original paper to be discussed publicly with a commission, as provided for by the Educational Regulations.
The educational programme enables graduates to:
- acquire an adequate cultural background to carry out research and experimentation activities, both basic and applied, and to develop and promote scientific and technological innovations in the field of agricultural production and technologies.
- develop skills to plan, design, conserve and enhance agricultural production systems and environmental and landscape resources.
- acquire command of scientific methods of investigation in the sectors of plant production, enabling them to intervene in the solution of problems on specific production systems and processes, through direct surveys in the field, determinations in the laboratory, data processing and interpretation.
- possess advanced skills to design, manage and certify agri-food systems, to create and manage parks, gardens, sports and recreational areas, in relation to technical means, machines and systems.
- pursue the qualitative and quantitative improvement of plant production through genetic selection, nursery management, design of cultivation systems, defence against biotic and abiotic agents, adoption of rational and innovative techniques and technologies.
- possess the dialectical ability to argue the technical-scientific aspects in professional inter-relations with specialists in the same or other sectors and in disseminating their technical beliefs to non-specialist agricultural operators.
- acquire skills in the field of international agricultural policy, market and marketing, economic evaluation of investments, as well as in the technical and economic aspects of product enhancement through the adoption of quality and safety systems, also in relation to the social roots of productive and consumer behaviours.
Educational activities consist of lectures, laboratory and field exercises and ongoing tests. The expected time to obtain the Degree is two academic years. To obtain the final qualification, students must have acquired 120 university credits (CFU) including those relating to the knowledge of the English language. The educational programme consists of 11 mandatory teachings and one chosen by the student, in addition to laboratories, practical-applicative internship at affiliated facilities and the final exam with the drafting and discussion of a degree thesis on specific topics of the course.
At the end of the course of study, the student obtains the 2nd cycle Degree in Agricultural Production and Technology and, after passing the national professional qualification exam, may enrol in section A (Senior Agronomist) of the professional register of the Board of Agronomists and Foresters.
