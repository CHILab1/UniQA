Educational objectives
The primary objective of the course is to train professionals who practice the full range of general dentistry with a holistic approach to oral health, both for prevention and cure. 
Some fundamental learning that the Degree Programme covers includes:
 - Anamnestic assessment of patients, with particular attention to diseases that may affect oral tissues and/or be relevant to the definition of a treatment plan;
 - Clinical examination of the oral cavity and the stomatognathic system;
 - Diagnosis of congenital and acquired diseases of teeth, oral mucosa, jaws, temporomandibular joints and related tissues;
 - Oral disease prevention for individuals and populations;
 - Therapy of congenital and acquired diseases of teeth, oral mucosa, jaws, temporomandibular joints and related tissues, as well as oral rehabilitation;
 - Prescription of drugs and devices for the treatment of oral diseases;
The Masterâ€™s Degree Programme provides 360 CFU (ECTS) of which at least 90 are to be acquired in clinical activities, integrated with in-person teaching. The CFU, which corresponds to 25 hours of average commitment per student, is assigned a value of at least 8 hours for in-person teaching and at least 10 hours for the preclinical and clinical internship; the remaining share of hours is available to the student for personal study.
The educational offer of the Degree Programme also includes the study of courses in the Bio-Medical and Medical areas. Preclinical and clinical internship participation is mandatory.
