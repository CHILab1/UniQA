Educational objectives
The degree course in Biotechnologies aims at providing students with the essential knowledge, behavioural and technical competences for a modern study and research methodology, for the use of biological functions and systems for the production of goods and services.
The educational programme enables students to acquire:
-	In the 1st year, basic knowledge in general and organic chemistry, biochemistry and mathematics which are indispensable for the educational programme and to understand specific disciplines. 
In addition, knowledge of the various biotechnology statutes and human rights and the applicability of the patent system to the biotechnology sector is provided.
-	 during the second year the students will deepen the most salient aspects of biotechnological training through the advanced study of biochemistry, molecular biology, molecular genetics and applied microbiology, which will be preparatory both for the final training and for the understanding of the subjects of the third year.
-	during the third year the students will take theoretical/practical classes, enabling them to approach the final exam and the internship period with knowledge ranging from agricultural biotechnology to clinical biochemistry, physiology and pathology.
Though the acquisition of credits related to elective activities and internships, students will be able to further orient their training path to attribute a professional role to the first cycle degree and possibly to continue their studies with second cycle degrees.
