Educational objectives
The Degree Course in “Global Studies. History, Policies, Cultures” aims at providing students with competences enabling them to acquire critical awareness of the relations among events and processes of the contemporary age and the past. The interdisciplinary approach to historical processes, read under a cultural, socio-economic and anthropological perspective, the acquisition of the relevant study methods, their connection with geographical and political teachings, provide a solid basic knowledge of global phenomena under a comparative perspective.
The Degree Course is structured in a single curriculum, aiming at providing solid training, focused on the knowledge of the most important institutional, economic, social, cultural, and religious phenomena from the ancient to the contemporary age. The educational programme provides students, in the first and second year, basic notions about the main historical periods as well as the knowledge of the methods of social sciences, useful for historical analysis (geography, political philosophy, political economics, anthropology). During the second and third course year, the course provides notions related to various areas of historical analysis and enables students to build an educational path responding to their specific interests. In fact, through the various options of the educational programme and using free credits, students will be able to get advanced knowledge in their specific area of interest. During the last year, students have the chance to learn the basics of sociological subjects and to analyse in depth paths connected to globalisation and to religious and cultural interaction. In addition, the choice to provide, in the third course year, a large group of optional subjects responds to the wish to provide students with the possibility of integrating their programme with further perspectives on globalism, through teachings covering political, social, literary areas, also in preparation of the 2nd cycle studies. This perspective will be further enriched by educational activities (credits “F” of the course syllabus) enhancing students’ informed participation as well as the consolidation of the theoretical and methodological tools acquired in the three years.
The educational programme has been designed taking into account two factors: the importance to follow a chronological order of historical subjects, to enable students to learn the evolution of phenomena; the will to include in the first year, and in the first semester of the second year subjects which, although not being propaedeutic to other subjects, provide students with functional knowledge and methodologies to tackle the teachings provided in the 2nd semester of the second year, and in the third year. 
It is believed that this educational framework can guarantee students a greater ease of understanding avoiding, therefore, slowdowns in their careers. At the end of the programme students will be able to use the most common IT tools useful for human sciences (on-line databases, bibliographic and source repertories, GIS methodologies).
Furthermore, it is believed that such organisation enables students to face the final examination with methodological and critical awareness having acquired, at the same time, the skills needed to start a 2nd cycle course.
The Degree Course in “Global Studies. History, Policies, Cultures” includes educational activities grouped as follows: a) basic educational activities; b) class-specific educational activities; c) educational activities in one or more related or integrative areas, with respect also to context cultures and interdisciplinary education; d) elective activities; e) educational activities for further linguistic knowledge f) laboratory activities.
