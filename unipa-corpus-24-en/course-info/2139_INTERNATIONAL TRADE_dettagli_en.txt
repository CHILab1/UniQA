With reference to the curriculum called "international studies", the educational objectives are:

- acquisition of the ability to identify and select relevant sources and data for the analysis of global political, legal and economic processes
- acquisition of the skills for analysing data of global political, legal and economic processes

- ability to analyse political and security risks related to investments and international commercial transactions
To achieve the above indicated educational objectives, during the first year, students will acquire the knowledge of a historical, political, economic and legal nature constituting the conceptual framework necessary to understand and analyse the global context, its evolutions and dynamics.
During the second year, with reference to the "international studies" curriculum, students will deepen the skills acquired in the first year focusing on the protection of human rights and on the regulatory strategies adopted by public administrations to face global challenges. In addition, further language skills will be acquired at the student's choice. 
With reference to the curriculum of "international trade", it aims at strengthening the corporate and legal technical skills (focused on the themes of international taxation and international commercial law), as well as a training period with private and public subjects directly involved in the processes of economic globalization
The training course culminates in the elaboration and discussion of an original written thesis carried out under the guidance of a lecturer among the professors of the Degree course, possibly accompanied by an external co-rapporteur from the realities in which the student carried out the training internship.
