Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle degree course in Energetic and Nuclear Engineering aims at training specialist engineers with competences in the field of design, planning and management of systems for the transformation of all forms of energy, with respect to traditional as well as to renewable and nuclear sources.
Graduates of this course may work in the field of private practice, as well as of industrial production and public administrations.
The course aims at providing a high cultural qualification through a modern educational offer adequate for the regional and national context.
The educational programme is characterised by a broad-spectrum core education, with respect to the technical and scientific skills, which are typical of industrial, and energy engineering, of the conversion and utilisation processes of conventional and renewable sources, and of nuclear engineering. 
The curricula “Industrial energy systems”, “Green energies”, and “Sustainable energies” provide three specialist educational paths.
Graduates of this course will be able:
-	To   master and apply engineering techniques, with respect in particular to energy and nuclear engineering;
-	to design and manage complex and/or innovative systems, processes and services;
-	to design and experimental tests and numerical simulations.
-	to understand and quantify the energy issues related to plants, buildings, technologies and systems. 
It is also planned to introduce the teaching of some disciplines in English in order to make the course more attractive for students coming from abroad
