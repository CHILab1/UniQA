The 2nd cycle Degree Course in Philosophy aims at providing students with advanced training in historical-philosophical studies as well as in the specific fields of theoretical, logical-epistemological and linguistic, gnosiological, philosophical-scientific, ethical-political and aesthetic research. Based on the competences they acquired during the 1st cycle, students should acquire advanced knowledge of the foremost methodologies for the historical-critical analysis of philosophical texts, with reference to the fundamental concepts, forms of argumentation, to particular languages, as well as to the theories and models of interpretation used in the various general and sectoral areas of philosophy. They will acquire the capability of planning an original research project, on an interdisciplinary basis and of making autonomous judgments on themes related to the philosophical debate and, more generally, on issues of the contemporary cultural debate.
