Educational objectives
The course aims at providing a complete and solid basic training in the cultural heritage subjects, and namely, through the division in two curricula, respectively related to the historical-archaeological heritage and to the material and immaterial cultural heritage of the region, for their communication and glamorization in the field of cultural tourism. The humanistic approach, providing students with the tools for the historical and anthropological understanding of assets and for their cultural and chronological positioning, is accompanied by a practical-operational approach, enabling them, through field activities, laboratories, and internships to acquire the most important methods for the recovery, conservation and restoration, as well as for the analysis and classification of the same assets, even by means of computer tools. 
Archaeology, history, history of art, literature and linguistics, geography, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, museology, are therefore accompanied by juridical and economic subjects, as well as by computing and language skills and various practical activities, laboratories and internships. 
The course provides for some core teachings, functional to the specificity of each curriculum; based on his/her interests, each student may choose a specific educational path through an appropriate selection among the proposed options. Guidance will be provided to make students’ choices more consistent and effective.
The acquisition of specific techniques and methodologies, as well as the practice of various subjects, with respect also to the labour market, is achieved through specific laboratories and internships, as well as – for the archaeological heritage - through the participation in excavations and landscape archaeological surveys.
The attention for core subjects, as well as the presence of a good number of common courses will avoid excessive specialization. At the same time, the wide range of class-specific (archaeological, historical-artistic, geographical and juridical-economic subjects) as well as of related and integrative teachings will enable students to have a wide and articulated vision of material and immaterial cultural heritage and to increase the possibility to fit in a labour market requiring flexibility as well as a wide range of competences, and to continue their studies with 2nd cycle degrees.
