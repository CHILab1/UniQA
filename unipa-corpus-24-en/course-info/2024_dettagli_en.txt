Educational objectives
Students of the 2nd cycle Degree in Aerospace Engineering acquire full command of the specific disciplines of the sector relating to fluid dynamics, flight dynamics and propulsion, as well as of those related to the construction, technological and testing aspects of Aerospace engineering.
They will also acquire the ability to apply the acquired knowledge to recognize, identify and analyse the typical aerospace design issues.
The fundamental objective is the development by the graduate of the ability to find, process, interpret and generalize, with a critical sense, the information required for the solution of multidisciplinary problems typical of the sector, possibly designing analytical and experimental campaigns that allow the production and acquisition missing data and information deemed useful.

Final examination features
It consists of the presentation and discussion of a written dissertation, containing the results of a work where the candidate will apply the knowledge and capabilities acquired during the course. The dissertation consists of an original project or a research on advanced aerospace issues. 
During the preparation of the thesis, students will acquire the ability to work independently and to find the necessary information using the reference literature.
In the presentation and discussion of the final paper, they will must demonstrate mastery of the topics covered, ability to place them in the reference context and a good level of communication.
Students will carry out their activity under the guidance of one or more supervisors, one of which should be a professor of the Degree Course.
The preparation of the final dissertation may be carried out at other Italian or foreign, public or private, institutions and companies, in the framework of cooperation agreements; the dissertation may be also prepared during internship periods.
The methods of assignment and details on the performance of the final exam are specified in the 'Regulations for the final examination of the 2nd cycle Degree in Aerospace Engineering', available on the CdS web page, accessible via the link
