Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in Communication for cultural heritage aims at training professionals who, together with solid cultural groundings in the areas of humanistic knowledge related to text sciences and visual culture, possess the theoretical knowledge and technical skills of communication specialists and can conceive and coordinate high-profile projects in the field of valorisation and use of cultural heritage and contemporary visuality.
One of specific objectives of the course is the achievement of a mature and conscious understanding of image sciences, considered as an interplay among the analysis of the image, the social and individual gaze and the media supporting such images, in relation to the evolution of technologies and possible translations between different languages. Furthermore, the course aims at providing a mature and conscious understanding of literary knowledge in its various articulations (critical-literary, linguistic and cultural) and their connection with modern comparative studies, theory of literature, history of culture, semiotics, historical-philosophical disciplines and computer science applied to human sciences.
Finally, the course aims at developing the aptitude for the analysis and design of solutions for the enhancement and use of cultural heritage, as well as for its greater understanding.
During the course students can experiment, through various professional laboratories, the close observation of aspects, methods, and techniques crucial for their future professional role by acquiring, according to the educational planning or to their personal interests and skills, useful knowledge for entering the labour market. Internship activities and specific training activities will also be carried out aimed at projecting students towards their future professional role. Some credits will also be allocated to further elective training activities.
The educational programme is divided into different areas of knowledge:
- semiotic-communication area, with teachings in cultural heritage semiotics, philosophy of experience, exhibition space semiotics.
- anthropological and social area, with teachings related to cultural heritage anthropology, laboratory of computational social sciences, laboratory of polling theories and techniques.
- legal area, with teachings such as Cultural Heritage regulations and History of political parties.
- economic-tourism and marketing area, with teachings in Cultural Heritage and Food and Wine Management, Cultural industrial economics.
- linguistic-literary and historical-artistic area, with teachings in Literary Communication, Visual Culture, Theory of Translation, Digital Philology, History of exhibitions and curation practice, Theory and history of art criticism, Theories of Interculturalism, Archaeology, Arab-Islamic cultural heritage, Theory of Seriality.
- creative and planning area, providing teachings such as Immersive technologies for Cultural Heritage, Virtual Archaeology Workshop, Communication Campaign Creation Workshop, Exhibit Design Laboratory, Service Design Workshop, Cultural Heritage Digitization Workshop.
During the first year, students acquire the skills necessary to understand the communicative and cultural aspects characterising material and immaterial cultural heritage. Alongside with semiotic and anthropologic knowledge related to the mechanisms constructing tradition and heritage, students will delve into the philosophical traits upon which their experience is based and explore literary heritage and the relevant communication.
Through the choice of two laboratories, in fact, students can acquire practical skills related to the creation of communication campaigns, market research and sociological analysis, design of services, digitization of cultural heritage and the construction of relevant virtual models, the design of exhibition spaces and installations. 
In this way, in addition to personalizing their own training path, students characterize their professional profile in a specific way. Through three elective courses, they can decide to deepen different traits of the many issues related to different sectors of communication, from historical-artistic-archaeological to economic ones, as well as to political, philosophical, and cultural issues.
The second year provides skills and tools to manage the cultural heritage at large, to understand visual culture and the way in which recent technologies changed the use of various types of contents. Students will also be able to study the semiotic mechanisms through which exhibition areas build experiences, enhancing what they host. 
Finally, through the internship, students will be able to put into practice what they have learned and possibly develop specific thesis projects together with companies.
The credits in terms of competences related to the labour market will be provided through the creation of a program of seminars with companies and professionals operating in various fields.
