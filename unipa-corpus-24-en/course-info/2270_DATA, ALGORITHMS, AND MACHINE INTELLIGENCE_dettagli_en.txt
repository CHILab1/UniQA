Educational objectives
The course deepens and strengthens the theoretical, methodological, systems engineering and technology knowledge, in all the disciplines which are the cultural core of computer science, studied in the first cycle (class L-31). Therefore, in accordance with the guidelines of National(GRIN) and international (ACM) Associations in the field, the course includes the formation of a solid knowledge of the fundamentals as well as of the applicative aspects of the various areas of computer science. 
The specific objectives of the course are: 
-  The acquisition of the scientific method of inquiry involving the use of mathematical tools supporting information technology and its applications; t
-  the deepening of the technologies of computer systems and information management; 
-  Further development of the methodologies for the design and implementation of information systems; 
-  Further investigation of the application areas of information systems and information technology. 
In addition to the completion of mathematical-physical training, the educational programme includes an advanced investigation of key issues such as information theory and computational models, and insights in specific areas. 
Among the various advanced courses it is worth mentioning the ones related to: 
-  The design of advanced algorithms and their implementation through in-depth knowledge of programming languages;
-  The methods for the management and analysis of large amounts of data, such as in the field of bioinformatics/biomedical and social sciences; 
-  The methods for the design of infrastructure and high-performance networks, with particular reference to the quality of service, and to the security and protection for the privacy of data; 
-  Web development and mobile technologies. 
In accordance to the specific objectives of the course, the educational programme includes: 
-  Lectures and laboratory exercises in class, autonomous project activities and individual activities in the laboratory; 
-  External activities such as internships in companies, public administration facilities and laboratories, as well as periods of study at other Italian and European universities, also in the framework of international agreements.

Final examination features
The final examination consists of the presentation of an original dissertation, aiming at ascertaining the level of individual technical scientific and professional competences.
Students must discuss an original dissertation prepared under the guidance of a supervising professor and aiming at ascertaining the level of their technical scientific and professional groundings. The dissertation may have an experimental, technical or project cut, and may be prepared by the student at the University as well as at a research laboratory or at other public and private, Italian or foreign institutions and companies, accredited by the University of Palermo, according to the terms agreed with the School. 
The preparation of the thesis (awarded with 18-24 CFU) is an important moment of reflection during which the student, if necessary, has the opportunity to integrate and streamline the learning experiences gained during the course to solve significant issues in the chosen specialisation field.
