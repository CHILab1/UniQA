Educational objectives
Graduates of the 2nd cycle degree course in Engineering and Innovative Technologies for the Environment should:
 - Possess advanced knowledge of the theoretical-scientific aspects of mathematical, physical and chemical sciences and of other core sciences ad be able to use this knowledge to interpret and describe complex engineering problems or problems requiring an interdisciplinary approach. 
- Possess advanced knowledge of the theoretical-scientific aspects of engineering at large as well as advanced knowledge of environmental engineering issues, where they should be capable of identifying, formulating and solving in an innovative way complex problems or problems requiring an interdisciplinary approach. 
- Be able to devise, plan, design and manage complex and/or innovative systems, processes and services, with respect, to the analysis and rehabilitation of surface water and groundwater, the processing of supply water, wastewater and waste management, the reclamation of contaminated sites, the analysis of air pollution and recovery techniques, the management of energy resources, the analysis and noise pollution control.
For a better qualification of acquired competences, the 2nd cycle Degree Course delves into environment related as well as soil defence issues. 
To this end, the first year delves into basic topics for the master's degree (hydraulics, hydrogeological risk) and some applied topics (remediation of contaminated sites, circular economy, energy efficiency, treatment of gaseous effluents, sustainable management of water resources). The second year is dedicated to the advanced study of topics characterizing the course, such as the processes of treatment of liquid effluents, waste management, urban hydraulic systems, coastal protection.

Professional opportunities
Profile: senior Engineer in Innovative Technologies for the Environment 
Functions: The main functions of this graduate are related to the use and/or development of innovative methods/technologies for: 
- the design of works for water and aeriform effluents processing and waste management.
- the planning of soil protection interventions. 
- the characterization of the contaminated sites and planning of remediation and/or safety measures. 
- the design of facilities for the use of alternative and renewable energy resources. 
- the conduction of experiments, analyses and interpretations of environmental data, aimed at the proper identification of the environmental state and of possible safeguarding and restoring interventions.
 - the participation in the drafting of Urban and Territorial Plans. 
- the conduction of environmental impact evaluation studies of plans and projects. 
Competences: 
The skills of the graduate in Engineering and Innovative Technologies for the Environment are related to the performance of field activities, the coordination and execution of project interventions concerning artifacts and works of environmental protection, soil protection and energy resources, the performance of monitoring and control activities of parameters characterizing natural and productive processes and the management of plants.
Career opportunities:
The employment opportunities for graduates in Engineering and Innovative Technologies for the Environment may be found in public and private bodies, companies, professional firms, freelance profession and, more generally, with all the subjects interested in planning, design, implementation, monitoring, control and management of interventions aimed at environmental protection, soil protection and the use of alternative and renewable energy resources.
The freelance activity is possible by enrolment, after passing the national qualification exam, in the Register of Engineers for section 'A' (senior engineers) and for the sector 'Civil and environmental engineering'.
Finally, the 2nd cycle degree also allows access, after passing a public competition, to PhD courses in topics pertinent to those covered during the studies.

Final examination features
The final exam of the 2nd cycle Degree Course consists of the presentation of a thesis developed in an original way by the student under the guidance of a supervisor, and aimed at ascertaining the technical-scientific and professional preparation, and of the discussion on questions possibly posed by the members of the Degree Commission.
The final exam is therefore aimed at evaluating the scientific maturity achieved by the student, the autonomy of judgment and mastery of the topics, the ability to operate autonomously and the communication skills, while the related discussion also aims at evaluating the general preparation of the student in relation to the Course educational contents
In order to improve contact between students and the job market, the degree thesis, even of an experimental nature, can derive from themes and topics addressed by the student during internships/stages in private companies and public bodies.
