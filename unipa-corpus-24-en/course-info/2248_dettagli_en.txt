Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in “Architecture for the sustainable project in the built environment”, class LM-4 aims at training professional with specific competence in the field of architecture, according to the provisions of the EEC directive 85/384. The degree course, through its educational activities, has its central nucleus in the architectural project at various scales, from the object, to the building, the town, the region; the project, which is carried out as a process, taking also advantage of its own procedures, constitutes an instrument of knowledge and experiential-scientific activity, which has as its object the physical reality in view of its useful and necessary modification to the life and living of man and the needs of associated life.
2nd cycle graduates in architecture must be able to design, at various scales, using the tools of architecture, including those of planning sciences, and must possess the skills to verify the feasibility of the project, the operations of construction of the works, of transformation and modification of the natural and artificial physical environment, with full awareness of the aesthetic, distributive, functional, structural, technical-constructive, infrastructural, managerial, geographical, economic and environmental aspects and with critical attention to cultural changes and to the needs expressed by the contemporary society.
The educational objectives aim at favouring the acquisition of the knowledge, skills and competences necessary for an architect to face the main current and future project challenges, with a view to a transformation and management of the built environment providing adequate, conscious and sustainable responses to the contemporary society.
At the end of the two-year course and through the exams, student must demonstrate their ability to achieve executive design syntheses in the fields of architectural and urban design, urban planning, construction of architecture, restoration of monuments: they must be able to produce specific thematic and disciplinary in-depth studies in view of the degree thesis.
A part of the training is oriented towards learning and knowledge of theories, methods, and disciplines; another theoretical-practical part of the training is oriented towards learning and practicing their "know-how" in the instrumental and specific professional activities. Theoretical-practical activities are carried out in the laboratories, that have as their purpose the description of the physical and architectural reality, and the knowledge, understanding and practice of the project. Attendance to the laboratories is mandatory, and it is ascertained by the teacher in charge. To ensure appropriate teaching assistance, also in accordance with the EEC Recommendation, referred to in point 1, paragraph 2, in the laboratories a personalized relationship must be ensured between the teacher and the learners such as to allow individual control of the project practice; therefore, no more than 50 students can be admitted to each laboratory.
Laboratories: Integrated Course “Laboratory of Survey and project of the built environment”, “Laboratory of Urban planning for the ecological city”, “Laboratory of Building Rehabilitation” and the integrated course “Laboratory of Restoration and Architectural Design in the built environment”; students can also choose one of the two optional laboratories: “Laboratory of Conservation and Consolidation of buildings” or “Laboratory of Sustainable Living Design” 
The Laboratories may be structured in modules and integrate more disciplinary area. Integration may be related to the same disciplinary area or different disciplinary areas. Some parts of the educational activity may also take place in qualified facilities of scientific research institutes as well as in the research and development departments of public or private agencies and companies operating in the field of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Urban Planning, subject to the stipulation of specific agreements that may also provide the support of experts for special educational activities (intensive courses, seminars, internships). In the second year, an experience in the world of work through a mandatory internship period is also specifically envisaged.
The Degree Course will address the architectural project with particular attention to the issues of modification and regeneration of consolidated urban and settlement fabrics, of grafting and transformation interventions, of their recovery, restoration, and enhancement, with respect also to open spaces. On the other hand, the course will deal with the new forms of contemporary living, investigating this complex phenomenon from residence to work, from culture to free time, from collective services to diffused museum systems, verifying it at different scales of intervention, up to the definition of the interior space and construction detail.
A correct balance between theoretical, practical and applicative aspects will be guaranteed, assuming the indispensable requisites of feasibility and environmental, economic and social sustainability as project data.
