Educational objectives
The single cycle degree course in Cultural Heritage Conservation and Restoration is held in collaboration with the Regional Department for Cultural Heritage and Identity of Sicily, through the Regional Centre for Design and Restoration. It is designed to train graduates, providing them with a professional profile corresponding to the qualification of Restorer of Cultural Heritage, in accordance to the art. 29 of Legislative Decree 42/ 04 and subsequent amendments, in all six ministerial specialisations.
The educational objective is, therefore, to train graduates able to work with operational and decision-making autonomy to identify the state of conservation of artefacts, to implement preventive, maintenance and restoration measures, limiting the degradation process of the constituent materials and ensuring their preservation contextualizing the artistic and cultural value of the works.
The educational programme is based on humanistic, scientific and technical subjects and involves the study of artistic techniques in their historical context, of the materials and methods for their knowledge and conservation, and of the control and prevention of the degradation processes. The following criteria underlie the educational programme:
- to give, to the necessary scientific and historical-artistic subjects, an appropriate number of credits;
- to provide enough time for practical restoration activities, through workshops and practical training in educational yards;
- To limit the number of integrated examinations to the extent permitted by the strong interdisciplinary nature of the degree program, methodological and cultural consistency is provided to the integrated courses.
