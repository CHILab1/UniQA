Educational objectives
The educational programme of the degree course has been designed in coherence with the qualifying training objectives of Class L-32 and aims at providing the scientific and methodological bases to obtain a solid knowledge for a systemic approach to the world of nature, seen in its biotic and abiotic components, in their relations, and in their historical development. The degree program provides two educational paths, the first of which aimed at developing skills in the natural sciences sector, especially through the deepening of the "biological disciplines", and the second providing knowledge and skills in the field of environmental sciences through the deepening of the "agricultural, chemical, physical, juridical, economic and contextual disciplines". This possibility of deepening the two different thematic aspects justifies the wide range of credits in the areas of "Biological Disciplines" and "Agricultural, Chemical, Physical, Legal, Economic and Contextual Disciplines".
Therefore, the formulation of the educational proposal entails the possibility of introducing further scientific-disciplinary sectors for class-specific activities, to provide a broader training offer that takes into account, above all, the right balance between the disciplines belonging to the biological sciences and earth sciences sectors. In the implementation of the cultural project it was decided to ensure a wide degree of freedom to the possibility of activating teachings in the sectors mentioned above, which are strategic to the degree project. This led to a wide range of credits for the basic and characterizing training activities, which may allow, in the preparation of the course syllabus, a more adequate adherence to the expected learning outcomes and to the available resources. The course includes from 39 to 66  credits for basic activities, to provide students with the solid scientific knowledge on which to set the specific study. The class specific activities are awarded with 54 to 102 CFU, with a substantial balance between the chemical, biological, ecological and Earth sciences disciplines, the cultural areas for graduates of this course, and a space for other disciplines completing the specific cultural training. The wide range of related and supplementary disciplines (from 18 to 30 CFU), integrates the acquired skills, even emphasizing disciplines already included among the class specific ones, for the specificity of the educational offer and of the relevant territorial context.
Finally, ample space is dedicated to other training activities (from 27 to 39 CFU), such as multidisciplinary excursions, internships, traineeships and other activities oriented towards entering the labour market, as well as stays at other Italian and European universities, under international agreements. In order to achieve the learning outcomes, the educational programme provides a good knowledge of the foundations of mathematics, physics and chemistry, also through the acquisition of the relevant basic languages. This basic knowledge will allow to address, through the application of the scientific method: the study of the forms, phenomena and processes of animal and plant organisms, also at an evolutionary level; knowledge of the Earth system, through the study of endogenous and exogenous processes; the understanding of the interdisciplinary aspects of studies on nature and the environment. Through exercises, laboratories and internship activities, students will acquire the ability to collect, analyse and process field and laboratory data; to learn experimental protocols and procedures, to apply and communicate them; to acquire the ability to apply appropriate safety and preventions measures in the laboratory and in the field.
Graduates of this course will therefore have acquired the scientific and methodological foundations enabling them to carry out professional activities, at an intermediate level of responsibility, in the various fields of natural and environmental sciences as support for the activities of control, management, recovery and planning of natural and anthropized environmental systems, as well as for activities of dissemination and scientific communication; they will also be able to effectively use, in written and oral form, at least one European Union language, within the specific area of competence.
