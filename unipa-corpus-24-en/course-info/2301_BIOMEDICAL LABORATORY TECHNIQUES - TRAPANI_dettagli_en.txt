Educational objectives
The specific training objectives are:
- Knowledge of the basic disciplines, such as to allow the understanding of the biological, physiological and pathological processes that develop in developmental, adult and geriatric age, on which their diagnostic intervention focuses, to responsibly guarantee the result and quality of the analytical data obtained.
- Knowledge of the methodological bases and operating principles of the analytical instrumentation for chemical-clinical, microbiological, biotechnological, immune-hematological, immunometric, anatomic-cyto-histopathological, clinical pathology and clinical biochemistry analyses.
- Ability to carry out, with professional autonomy, the technical procedures needed for the execution of diagnostic methods on different biological matrices.
- Ability to critically evaluate the analytical results in compliance with the quality management systems in the laboratory.
- Ability to apply the principles of safety in the workplace and of prevention and protection measures as well as radiation protection.
-Understanding of the basics of healthcare management, the main bioethical issues in healthcare systems, as well as ability to establish interdisciplinary collaborations with the various professionals in the workplace and to act consistently with the disciplinary, ethical and deontological principles of the profession.
- Ability in managing information systems in healthcare facilities.
- Ability to manage their own professional growth in line with technological and scientific progress.
-Ability to use the English language in the specific area of expertise and to exchange general information.
The achievement of professional skills is achieved through theoretical and practical training also including the acquisition of behavioural skills, carried out in the specific work context of each profile, so as to guarantee, at the end of the training course, full mastery of all the necessary skills and their immediate usability in the workplace.
The Degree Course is divided into three years and provides for a total of 180 credits (CFU), of which 60 must be acquired in professionalizing training activities aimed at developing specific professional skills. The Degree Course is organized into lectures, seminars, laboratory exercises and practical internships, constituting the professional training of the Biomedical Laboratory Technician.
Of particular importance, as an integral and qualifying part of the professional training, is the practical training activity of internship, aimed at providing specific operating methods of laboratories work flows as well as applying the knowledge acquired during the frontal teaching activities. The professionalizing internship starts from the first year and is carried out with the supervision and guidance of specifically assigned professional tutors, coordinated by a teacher with a higher training level and belonging to the professional profile of the Degree Course.
Learning in individual teachings is verified through educational assessments and certified assessments. Educational assessments (ongoing tests) aim exclusively at detecting the effectiveness of learning and teaching processes with respect to specific contents and objectives. Certified assessments (profit exams) aim, instead, at evaluating and quantifying with a grade the achievement of the objectives of the teaching courses by certifying the degree of individual preparation of the students.
The final exam consists of a qualifying practical test relating to the laboratory methodologies learned during the professionalizing internship activities, as well as of the drafting and discussion of a short essay aimed at verifying the skills of the graduate on a topic consistent with the educational objectives of the Degree Course.
The cultural and professional profile of graduates in Biomedical Laboratory Techniques enables them to carry out their activity with technical and professional autonomy in direct collaboration with other laboratory personnel in charge of the various operational functions; they must be responsible, in the laboratory structures, for the correct fulfilment of the analytical procedures and their work, within the scope of their functions in application of the work protocols defined by the responsible managers; they must verify the correspondence of the services provided to the indicators and standards predefined by the manager of the facility; they check and verify the correct functioning of the equipment used, provide for ordinary maintenance and the possible elimination of small inconveniences; they participate in the planning and organization of work; they carry out their activity in public and private laboratory facilities, authorized according to the current legislation, as employees or freelancers; furthermore, the Biomedical Laboratory technicians contribute to the training of support staff and to the updating relating to their professional profile and to research.
