Educational objectives
Specific objectives:
The course provides university-level knowledge and understanding (including the ability to read and understand advanced and updated texts) in the following three fields: a) legal; b) business-economic; c) management engineering (principles). To be more concrete, graduates of this course should be able to: a) choose the most appropriate legal form for starting a business; apply for the necessary administrative permissions/concessions; register the activity in the competent offices; get a VAT number; hire their own employees, conclude contracts for the supply of goods and services, conclude contracts for the sale of goods and services, etc .; b) plan their activities from an economic-financial point of view; determine the extent of the necessary capital; choose the best ratio between equity capital and borrowed capital; enable a proper system of solvency and cost controls; change in time their entrepreneurial formula; rearrange the production factors in response to changing market needs; c) use technology, especially information technology, as a productive factor; use technology for the supply of raw materials and/or for the sale and distribution of their products and/or services (e-procurement, e-commerce, etc.); assess whether and to what extent it is convenient to do research and development within the company and beyond which point would not be better to conclude synergies with universities or other research centres according to the model of so-called open innovations.
The program includes:
-	the teaching of private law, constitutional law, business economics, corporate accounting and management of the so-called open innovation
-	the teaching of the main professional subjects (commercial law, tax law, labour law, administrative law, private international law, comparative law and techniques and simulation of trading).
-	the teaching of subjects aimed at providing the necessary historical and ethical-philosophical references.
-	an offer of advanced subjects, as well as of related and integrative subjects available in other University courses.
The teachings will be distributed in the three years according to an educational process aiming at facilitating a critical and multidisciplinary learning, during which students will be called to face from the beginning the "enterprise" as a whole, under a pedagogical paradigm aiming at overcoming certain excesses in the partitioning of those subjects which, form various perspectives, deal with business. This therefore explains why the course instead of following a traditional path (first year-core subjects, second year-class-specific subjects and third year-specialist subjects), has a circular outline, within which the same problem will be examined from different perspectives.
In addition, the provision of tutorials, simulations in the classroom and the internship provide the student with an approach as close as possible to the work environment.
