Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in Social Work, inequalities and social vulnerabilities aims at educating professionals capable of carrying out social analyses of the territory, understanding its issues and carrying out managerial activities in the relevant public administrations or private social organisations, to tackle the various social situations, proposing adequate solutions to the complexity of social issues.
In view of this objective, the course provides an interdisciplinary approach, based upon a close link between professional social work subjects and sociological, juridical, political-economic, psychological, and philosophical-political subjects in their various articulations. A particular attention is paid not only to core sociological subjects, but also to other scientific areas for their importance in the understanding of social processes and in an adequate construction of targeted social policies, and namely: 
a)	Private law and administrative law, with some specific issues of the Course (citizenship rights, rights of migrants, rights of minors, social effects of policies and laws concerning the regulation of welfare)
b)	The sector of business organisation with respect to the functioning of public economy, the activity of local agencies, the problems related to budget management and to the coordination and organisation of interventions in the territory, as well as the coordination and management activities of cooperation and non-profit organisations.
The educational programme also aims at providing advanced skills through class-specific teachings, also in the fields of social psychology, political science (specifically for the analysis of welfare systems and local policies), of political philosophy.
These teachings are accompanied by other related and integrative educational activities, in the sector IUS/20 Legal Philosophy, with the teaching “Human rights” related to the management of migration fluxes and SPS/7 with a teaching related to the relation among social policies, social cooperation and non-profit organisations.
