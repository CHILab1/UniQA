Educational objectives
Specific objectives: The interclass degree in Musicology and Performance Studies provides in-depth historical and theoretical knowledge of music, theatre, cinema, of their mutual relationships and of the ways they are disseminated. It also provides adequate competence in the literary, philosophical, economic subjects, completing the preparation of students in an interdisciplinary perspective. 
The course trains students able to carry out independently original research and professional activities in the fields of disciplines characterizing the two degree classes, from teaching to media stusied, to cultural organisation and management. 
Students will deepen the competences acquired, with respect to musicology, ethnomusicology, theatre, performing arts, cinema and audio-visual media. They will also acquire theoretical and practical advanced skills on the ways and forms of traditional and high-tech digital live performing arts (music and theatre) such as multimedia installations and technological theatre, as well as similar experience about the ways and forms of audio-visual, film, television and multimedia online and off-line products. 
They will also acquire management skills
The educational programme provides students of both curricula with the knowledge required for the two degree classes (interclass), however the second year focuses specifically on one of the two learning areas (Musicology / Entertainment).
To deepen the theoretical-practical knowledge in the field of class-specific subjects, the course combines musicological disciplines of common interest to the two degree classes (L-ART / 07: History and didactics of musical theater and Poetry and image), to teachings related to the History of theater and cinema (L-ART / 05 and L-ART / 06: Theories and techniques of acting, Practices of cinematographic and audiovisual direction, Theories of cinema).
There is also a teaching related to research methodology.
Among the class specific subjects in  the literary field, the field of English literature and theater has been privileged (L-LIN/10), not only for the value that the English theatrical tradition has in the history of European civilization, but also for the possibility of dealing with contemporary rewrites of this tradition in various English-speaking countries.
As for related disciplines, the teaching of Organization and production of the show (SECS-P/10), provides the necessary skills to fit into this professional field, while the teaching of the sector ICAR/14 (for the LM- class 65) is intended for theoretical reflection on space in cinema and theater. In the Musicology curriculum, the teaching of Musical Pedagogy (M-PED/01) and Anthropology of Music (L-ART/08) reinforce the pedagogical and anthropological knowledge already acquired in the 1st cycle course, in line with the provisions of the Ministerial Decree 616/2010 on access to teaching competition classes.
A curricular internship is foreseen, useful for expanding technical and practical skills. The internship activities are in fact an important element of contact with the labour market and the professions related to perfroming arts.
The course also provides additional language skills. 
The above objectives are achieved through: 
-the use of lectures and seminars and the subsequent verification of skills acquired both in class and during individual study through written and/or oral examinations; 
- the possible preparation of written texts or literature searches; - 
- the participation in workshops and internships; 
- the preparation of a written final paper, under the guidance of a supervising professorm considered an essential moment of personal elaboration of the acquired knowledge and methodologies.
