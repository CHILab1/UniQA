Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course in "Biodiversity and Environmental Biology" completes the training in biological subjects received during the 1st cycle Degree in Biology or other similar degrees, related to natural science and environment topics. 
The foremost objective is to train expert graduates with advanced and operational skills in the field of biodiversity, seen as an integrated evolving system, from the understanding and defence of which the maintenance of the biological and environmental balance depends, for the sustainable use of biological and environmental resources too. 
Individual teachings use the knowledge of the properties of biological systems acquired in the previous three-year degree, improving the skills about issues related to the organism-environment interaction and to the evolutionary mechanisms generating biodiversity. 
Particularly important is the acquisition of methodological, instrumental and analytical skills for the: 1. Knowledge of evolution and taxonomic diversity; 2. Characterisation of environment and natural biological resources; 3. determination of molecular and genetic markers for the taxonomic identification, phylogenesis and adaptive responses: 4. Naturalistic and educational dissemination of biological disciplines.
The always more widespread need for a renewed relationship between man and nature, aware of the need to integrate the knowledge and protection of biodiversity and natural systems with anthropic activities, at local and global level, requires professional skills aiming above all at understanding the biological mechanisms by which with which living organisms settle and evolve, adapting or not, in their environment.
The educational programme therefore includes the study of animal and plant biodiversity, of the structural and functional adaptations related to development and reproduction, of behavioural adaptations, of the interactions between organisms/populations and the environment.
The integrated and comparative approach provides for the knowledge of modern methods of analysis, in the field and in the laboratory, which find application and completion in the choice and implementation of the experimental thesis.
The educational programme and the development of the thesis are supported by training internships in the field and/or in the laboratory, by attendance in qualified research laboratories and by internships aimed at acquiring technical and relational skills useful for fitting in the field of applied research and in the labour market. Specific objectives, in this regard, are the activities related to environmental management, to the techniques of characterization and enhancement of biological resources, also in terms of innovative products, to naturalistic museology and in general to the knowledge and protection of the natural heritage.
The course is also structured in relation to the scientific and professional activities carried out at the site, with particular reference to applications in the Mediterranean area, and enables graduates to work independently, also assuming roles of responsibility for projects, facility and staff management. In addition, the 2nd cycle Degree enable the continuation towards higher education through PhD courses.
The programme includes:
- the completion of the training in zoology and botany under a taxonomic and bio-molecular perspective;
-the completion and deepening of the study of the biological evolution mechanisms also with reference to the genetic structure;
- knowledge of the most modern methods of analysing biodiversity, natural ecosystems and products of biological origin, also as a function of human-environment interactions;
- knowledge of methods for environmental monitoring and conservation of biodiversity;
- the study of ecophysiological and adaptive responses at the level of organisms, populations, species and communities;
- the study of biogeography;
- knowledge of regulatory and legal traits in terms of environmental management and sustainability.
The learning and acquisition of professional skills is measured in credits, in accordance with the provisions of the University Educational Regulations.
Classes are held in two semesters and consist of lectures, practical and/or field exercises.
Students will have to complete an internship period at research institutions or companies affiliated with the University of Palermo, which may also be aimed at the preparation of the thesis. The structure and articulation of each teaching and of the other educational activities are specified annually in the Degree Course Regulations. All information is available on the degree course website.
