Educational objectives
Specific objectives:
Within an integrated path of historical-archaeological and historical-artistic cut, the Degree Course aims in particular at satisfying the need for functional professionalism in heritage education, in addition to the traditional areas of conservation, management and enhancement of cultural heritage, in the spirit of the so-called "Faro Convention", ratified by 20 member countries of the Council of Europe, including Italy, which has expressly brought the conscious enjoyment and sharing of cultural heritage back into the fold of the fundamental rights of the individual.
The objective is to further define and qualify the profiles of museum educator and operator of educational services of cultural sites, as well as of the teaching staff and future schoolteachers of historical-artistic and humanistic disciplines with targeted training, enhancing the indispensable advanced skills on archaeological and historical-artistic assets at the centre of heritage education actions.
On the basis of these assumptions, the training project focuses on the specific subjects common to the two classes LM-2 and LM-89, with  some class-specific sectors of one class and related sectors of the other (or vice versa) providing the necessary completion of knowledge on the historical-cultural contexts, on the sources and on the technical and conservative, regulatory and financial aspects, ensuring a robust training in archaeological and artistic heritage disciplines which is essential for the quality and effectiveness of the graduates' activity; to this end, the aforementioned disciplinary training, through the selection of themes and paths, laboratory teaching and practice, is declined in function of the interpretation of the heritage, the transfer of knowledge and the acquisition of specific operational skills by the graduates. The degree course includes a robust series of mandatory teachings, some optional ones and language (English language B2), specific computer laboratories, as well as a significant internship activity, in addition to the elective credits and the credits of the final exam, consisting in the the application of the knowledge and skills acquired to a significant case study. 12 credits are dedicated to laboratory courses in class-specific areas, essential for the strong declination of the course, half of which are held in English. Students will be given the opportunity to follow two other courses in a language other than Italian, to obtain a more marketable education in the European context and to be able to transmit the acquired disciplinary skills to a wider audience. Finally, integrative teaching activities are planned, namely seminars relating to the themes of heritage education and the pedagogy of cultural heritage, held by qualified experts. The teachings cover the areas of Ancient History and Archaeology, History of Art and Museology, History of Architecture, Restoration and Chemical-Physical Disciplines for Diagnostics and Restoration, Modern History and Archives, Economics and Legislation, in order to fully satisfy the requirements of both classes LM-2 and LM-89 and, above all, to guarantee a solid preparation in the class specific areas, which have also been drawn upon for related disciplines, and a wide versatility for post-graduate career opportunities: in fact, the aim is to leave graduates the possibility of opting, depending on the arising opportunities, also for other career paths allowed by the two classes, as archaeologists or specialist art historians, or to access the training for secondary teaching. In particular, the integration of the archaeological subjects (covering classical archaeology and art history, prehistory and landscape archaeology), historical subjects (antiquity and the modern age) including the archives field, historical-artistic subjects (relating to the Middle Ages and the modern age, museology as well as the history of architecture) and subjects related to diagnostics, restoration, legislation, economics, provide graduates with a complete training, whether they opt for the LM-2 class or the LM-89 class, to be able to find their way in the fields of conservation, museum management and enhancement, with reference to archaeological assets and contexts as well as assets and contexts of historical-artistic interest.
