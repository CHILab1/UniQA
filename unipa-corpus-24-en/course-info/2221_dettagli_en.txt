Educational objectives
The Degree Course in Civil Engineering) specifically aims at training professionals capable of working in technical and technical-organizational positions in contexts requiring the knowledge of the methodological-operational aspects of core sciences as well as of civil engineering, For this reason, the course provides for the basic mathematics-physics and scientific-technical training needed to interpret, describe and solve specific problems, enabling students to learn, also through individual study, and to update their competences, both autonomously and through specific teachings,
The objective is to enable graduates to enter the labour market with the autonomous capability of changing and adapting to various functions (technician releasing authorizations and the like in public agencies and administrations, yard technicians, planning support, etc…) without being limited in closed areas by an excessively sectorial training.
The course provides basic knowledge with respect to:
-	The principles, methods and tools for structures modelling and calculation, as well as the criteria for the design of structural elements and structures of medium complexity in reinforced concrete and steel by means of recurrent patterns.
-	The principles, methodologies and tools for the calculation of the design variables and for designing hydraulic structures of medium complexity in urban and suburban areas, through the application of recurring and consolidated computational methods.
-	The criteria and methods for geometric design of road infrastructures and their safety, management and construction.
-	The (urban collective, railroad, individual) transport systems engineering, with respect to the analysis of transport demand and supply.
-	Survey Engineering and the criteria, problems and methodologies for the survey, control, monitoring and representation of structures and land, as well as the basic methods for data processing with respect to the system and the realization of topographic surveys of medium complexity at different scales and extension.
-	The principles of the physical and mechanical characterization of land and the main experimental methods for the identification of the relevant parameters.
-	The methods to perform experimental tests of medium difficulty and interpreting data in various fields of Civil Engineering.
The course is structured as follows:
-	The first year provides the basic knowledge for achieving a scientific language in mathematics, chemistry, physics and representation, preparatory for further studies, and also the testing of at least one foreign language.
-	The second year provides some disciplines in the fields of mathematics and physics as well as other disciplines of civil engineering, useful for the scientific and technical training needed to interpret, describe and solve the typical issues of the educational programme.
-	The third year provides for the typical applied knowledge of the class L -7 aiming at the achievement of the above-mentioned specific objectives.
The educational methods and teaching tools through which the expected learning outcomes are achieved are the following: lectures and classroom exercises, laboratory activities, technical visits, internships at companies, government agencies, professional firms and engineering companies, seminars, participation in Conferences.
The programme is completed by elective courses (at least 12 credits), other activities, useful for entering the labour market (at least 3 credits) and the final examination (at least 3 credits), aiming at assessing the achievement of learning outcomes as well as students’ independence of judgment and communication skills.
