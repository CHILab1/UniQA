Educational objectives
The 1st cycle Degree course provides for a flexible path, either oriented on purely engineering aspects (Engineering curriculum), or integrated by aspects related to the Architecture of the building (Architecture curriculum).
In the Engineering curriculum,  the first year provides students with the basic language of engineering and includes teachings in the fields of mathematics, physics, technical and compositional architecture, and the history of architecture; the second year completes the basic training started the first year and provides student with the typical languages of construction engineering, including teachings related to hydraulic plant engineering and technical installations, as well as teachings related to the structures, and teachings concerning urban planning and topography; the third year prepares the student on applications to construction engineering, in particular in the areas of structural design of new and the existing buildings. The third year is completed with two elective courses enabling students to deepen the legislation  related to urban planning, to public works and/or facilities and/or to the roads serving residential areas and/or to project management and/or to restoration.
The second curriculum differs from the first one for the introduction of teachings with more specific architectural/town planning orientation. In particular, the course provides more teachings related to the history of architecture and architectural design. The third year is completed by two optional courses as in the case of the first curriculum.
The training is completed by the activities pursuant to Article 10 and by the final work, contributing, together with all the other courses providing for group activities, to the development of relational and contextual skills.
The degree course is divided into four learning areas. The first one is related to basic mathematical, chemical and physical scientific training; the second concerns general engineering training in the construction sector; the third concerns the specific building engineering training, the fourth one is dedicated to relational and contextual training.

Final examination features
The final exam consists of a brief presentation by the student followed by an interview with the examining Board. The subject of the presentation and subsequent discussion is chosen by the student from a list of topics prepared by the Board of the Degree course with its own resolution and published, at the beginning of each academic year, on the course website. Based on the suggested bibliography, during the interview the student will have to demonstrate to be able to analyse, deepen and critically re-elaborate the proposed topic as well as being able to communicate effectively and professionally.
