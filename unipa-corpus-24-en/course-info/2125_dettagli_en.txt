Educational objectives
The Degree Course provides core competences in the field of applied ecology and of the techniques for surveying the qualitative and quantitative characters of forest stands, the main methods and techniques for the analysis, execution and management of operations in forest and pre-forest environments.
Graduates of this course should acquire core competences in propaedeutic subjects such as Mathematics, Chemistry, Plant Biology which, together with elements of Physics and Animal Biology are needed to understand the principles of specific professional subjects. These competences will enable students to achieve a professional training including the principles of sylviculture, the main forest management types, the management of adverse situations for forest species, the elements of soil sciences and of hydraulic-forest settlements. 
Graduates will gain understanding of the dendrometric and descriptive surveying techniques that will enable them to carry out field surveys and the relevant qualitative and quantitative processing, to correctly understand the natural phenomena of forest stands evolution. Likewise, they will acquire knowledge of the main industry regulations and of the principles of forestry economics and valuation needed for autonomous professional activities such as the planning and settling of small businesses, evaluation of land, technical means, plant and forest products; afforestation projects and related valuations;  forest work of land exploitation and amelioration; rural development and technical-economic management of small farms, protected areas and processing companies. The profile requires the dialectical skills needed to disclose and argue one’s own technical ideas with specialists and non-specialists, as well as the command of English language or of another European language, which is necessary for reading and interpreting technical texts, for professional exchanges and for basic dissemination.
Acquired competences will enable graduates to tackle and solve, as junior professionals the following issues: 
-  Sustainable management and development of forest and environmental heritage;
-  Forestry and environmental monitoring, survey and valuation;
-   Knowledge of issues related to forest products and their use;
-   Defence of forests and the environment from biotic and abiotic damages;
- Soil defence through a sustainable territorial management
-  Defence of the territory through hydraulic works.
Educational activities will be carried out through lectures, laboratory and field practice and mid-term testing.
The course lasts three academic years. To achieve the degree, students must have acquired 180 credits (CFU), including the ones related to the knowledge of an European Union language, besides Italian, subject to the special rules for the protection of linguistic minorities.
The educational programme provides for 19 mandatory examinations for 7-8 credits each, a language test, elective activities, a practical training period in external facilities and the final examination about specific course issues.
As for mandatory teachings, a least 25% of frontal teaching must consist of laboratory activity, practice, field activities
The 12 elective credits may be acquired, in accordance with article 10, paragraph 5, letter a) of DM 270/04, choosing freely among teachings provided by other courses of the  University of Palermo and other associated Italian and foreign universities. 
Students must also acquire up to 3 CFUs for professionalising activities, useful to find employment opportunities (art.10, paragraph 10, letter d) of D.M. 270/04)
At the end of the course, students obtain the title of “Dottore in Scienze Forestali ed Ambientali” and, after passing the professional qualification examination, they may register in Section B (Dottore Forestale Junior) of the professional register.
