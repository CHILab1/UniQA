Educational objectives
The Interclass Degree Course in Food Communication combines the skills and objectives of two different degree classes, intertwining studies on Communication Theories (class LM-92) with those concerning Gastronomic Sciences (class LM/GASTR), focusing on the communicative aspects that characterize food and wine both as a system of meaning and as an object of multiple artifacts and communicative processes.
Graduates in Food Communication are innovative professionals who can work as freelancers as well as in private companies and in the public sector. They combine the technical skills related to the production and consumption of food and wine, to their marketing and to their media repercussions, with the notions and sensibilities of socio-semiotics, cultural geography, aesthetics enabling them to give back to the food phenomenon the cultural and symbolic depth characterising it, being able therefore to operate with awareness and effectiveness, in the promotion of food and wine products in different socio-cultural contexts as well as in food education or in the production of different text types, from food and wine journalism to guides, from social media to television broadcasts, etc.
The educational programme is divided into different areas of knowledge:
- Semiotic-communicative area, with teachings such as Food and Wine Languages and Food Experience, Media and food and wine, Brand Semiotics, Design and food packaging, Semiotics of consumption spaces, Theory and techniques of seriality.
- Historical, anthropological, geographical, and social area, with the teachings: Ethnogastronomy, History of Food, Food Consumption Sociology.
- Area of Food Sciences and Nutrition, with the teachings: Mediterranean Food Systems and Supply Chains, Nutrition and Health, Sensory Analysis and Wine Production.
- Legal area, with the teaching: Agri-Food Law.
- Economic-Tourism and Marketing area, with teaching such as Food and Wine Marketing and Tourism, Cultural and Food and Wine Heritage Management.
- Creativity and design area, with the teachings: Communication Campaign Workshop, Exhibit Design Workshop, Food Writing Workshop.
During the first course year, students acquire the skills necessary to understand the communicative and cultural aspects characterizing food and wine systems, the history of food and the social dimension associated with food consumption. The basis for understanding the mechanisms of taste experience is also provided. Furthermore, through the laboratories, students will acquire practical skills related to the creation of communication campaigns, to the writing of different text types, and to the design of consumption spaces. An elective course will enable them to decide to personalise their own path, deepening different aspects of the food phenomenon, from the more technical ones such as the nutritional aspects or the production dynamics in the wine sector, to the more communicative ones related to the construction and management of the brand, to the packaging design, to the analysis of the consumption spaces, up to the legal or managerial aspects.
In the second year, skills and tools will be provided to analyse the media impact of food and wine, the aesthetic peculiarities of food taste as well as tasting techniques. These skills will be complemented by those related to food and wine marketing and to the tourism dynamics caused by food and wine, as well as to the production aspects and the link they have with quality certifications and therefore with their economic repercussions. Through the elective activities students will be able to complete their own path in the direction they wish. Finally, through the internship, students will be able to put into practice what they have learned and eventually develop specific thesis projects together with companies.
The credits in subjects useful for entering the job market will be provided through a program of seminars with companies and professionals operating in various fields: from catering to journalism, from education to marketing.
