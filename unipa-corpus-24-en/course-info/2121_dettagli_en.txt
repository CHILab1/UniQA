Educational objectives
The course aims at training professionals in psychological sciences who can carry out technical-operational in the field of psychology with regard to people, groups, social organisms and communities.
The course aims at providing the basic groundings to operate as technical-operational professionals, within coordinated activities and under the supervision of a 2nd cycle graduate in Psychology, in the functions of prevention, assistance, support, promotion, evaluation and development in various areas such as, for example, health, couple and family services, management and development of human resources, work in institutions and social and community contexts.
The course provides solid and up-to-date basic training in the various sectors of psychology (general, social and developmental psychology, psychophysiological mechanisms underlying behaviour, dynamics of human relationships, in the individual, family, groups and institutions, clinical psychology, and psychological research methodology) and also an interdisciplinary training, important for the understanding of psychology in the fields of demo-ethnoanthropological disciplines, philosophy and social statistics.
The course also provides basic skills in IT and English.
The theoretical methodological training is always accompanied by experiential and laboratory activities. The syllabus, pursuant to the Interministerial Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022 of Law no. 163, provides that 10 credits are acquired by carrying out a practical-evaluation internship (TPV), consisting of contextualized and supervised practical activities, which involve direct observation and the execution of activities aimed at learning in situation and at the development of procedural and relational skills and abilities essential for the exercise of the professional activity.
Upon completion of a semester of post-graduate professional internship, the degree course in 'Psychological Sciences and Techniques' allows access to the State Exam for section B of the Register of Psychologists, as well as to carry out professional activities at a technical-operational level.
For the Psychologist professional qualification and the enrolment in Section A of the Register, graduates must complete five-year studies. The 2nd cycle degree in the LM51 class enables graduates to practice the profession of psychologist (Interministerial Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022).
The educational objective of the course of study is achieved through a path providing the theoretical and methodological tools suitable for operating effectively in:
- activities aimed at diagnosing, understanding and supporting individuals, families and groups, in order to promote their development and well-being and limit their discomfort;
- analysis and development of communication processes;
- prevention, evaluation and help and support interventions in psychological discomfort connected to problems of maladjustment and social deviance, psychological trauma, physical and mental illness, risk behaviours;

- assessment of the child and parental figures, in the context of psychological intervention in support of the mother-child and father-child relationship, as well as in situations of social and relational distress (e.g. maternity at risk, etc.), and in support of parenthood in critical moments of the life cycle;
- empowerment programs and interventions for individuals and local communities;
- activities in public and private services aimed at the optimal use of human resources in work and organizational contexts, through the identification and understanding of the psychological-social processes underlying performance, interpersonal relationships and the professional objectives pursued;
- planning of interventions with public and private administrations and bodies for the promotion of well-being, organizational development and human and professional resources;
- evaluation of local community profiles for the definition of the quality of life of neighbourhoods, towns, services and organization and the development of spontaneous, informal and formal associative networks in the area;

Course outline
The first year provides an adequate basic knowledge of the foundations of psychology (general psychology, psychobiology and physiological psychology, developmental and educational psychology) and an interdisciplinary training in the fields of demo-ethnoanthropological disciplines and the history of philosophy. In addition, there are teachings aiming at consolidating and updating students' knowledge in computer science, quantitative analysis and English language. All courses develop basic theoretical-methodological aspects without neglecting the practical component.
During the second year, the course becomes more operational. In addition to the mandatory activities related to dynamic and clinical psychology, developmental and educational psychology, psychometrics and social statistics, there are activities connected to the practical internal evaluation training related to the relational skills of the psychologist and the laboratories on the use of the tests.
The s third and final year provides teachings related to the areas of dynamic, clinical, industrial, and organization psychology as well as practical activities relating to TVP, practical evaluation training (both internal and external) and practical qualitative and quantitative research laboratories.
Finally, the course provides elective teachings, which aim to guide students towards the specific 2nd cycle degrees.
All courses include exercises and laboratory activities to enable students to apply their knowledge and understanding in the various professional fields to which the degree refers.
TPV's activities not only fit into the same framework but also favour the development of soft skills.
At the end of the course students will have acquired basic skills related to the various areas of Psychology as well as to research and data analysis in psychology.
