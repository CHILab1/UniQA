Educational objectives
The 1st cycle Degree course in Physics aims at providing students with solid groundings in classical and modern physics, open to subsequent  refinement in 2nd cycle courses; graduates may find professional opportunities where familiarity with the scientific method and capability of using innovative methodologies and complex equipment are required.
Graduates in Physics should:
-  Possess good basic groundings in the various sectors of classical and modern physics; and in particular, sound basic in-depth knowledge of classical and relativistic mechanics, thermal dynamics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and structure of matter, together with the foundations of nuclear physics, physics of the circumterrestrial medium, and astronomy;
-  Acquire familiarity with the scientific investigation method and, in particular, with the representation and modelling of physical reality and their testing;
-  Possess operational and laboratory skills, having learned to carry out laboratory experiments (and to analyse the relevant results) on all the issues of Physics tackled during the degree course and refined through the relevant modules;
-  Understand mathematical and computer tools and be able to use them, as well as be able to use the tools of mathematical analysis, algebra and geometry with respect to physics issues, and be able to develop, tune and use computer codes for solving mathematical problems in the context of Physics;
-  Acquire the ability to operate professionally in specific applicative ambits, such as scientific support to industrial activities and to the cultural heritage,  as well as in various activities aiming at the dissemination of scientific culture;
-  Acquire the ability of using English language, besides Italian, in their specific professional field and to exchange general information; students learn (or consolidate) English language, and they also use texts and scientific articles in English;
-  Possess sound competences and tools for communication and for information management, therefore being able to prepare exhaustive and quantitative reports on the experiments carried out, to draw short papers to investigate specific issues, to present in oral for, also through the use of computer tools, their works or results, to present and discuss a specific topic during their final examination;
  Acquire the ability of working in group, of working with a certain autonomy, namely in the performance of laboratory experiments and in the preparation of the final paper, and to fit easily into work environments.
These skills are acquired both in core teachings and in more specific teachings related to specific issues, and are verified during mid-term tests, the discussion of term papers and lab reports, exams, the final examination. 
To achieve the educational objectives, the educational programme is structured in a way as to provide students with skills in the physical field as well as integrative skills in a progressive manner. The degree course provides a single path, whose educational activities consist of lectures, exercises and laboratories, with internship experiences at external agencies, participation in cultural and scientific enrichment events, and the acquisition of English language skills. Through the University Language Centre (CLA) the necessary resources (courses, tests, bibliographic resources, ...) are made available to students, enabling them to pass from the A2 level of knowledge of the English language to the expected outgoing level (B1).
During the first year, students mainly acquire basic knowledge of theoretical and laboratory classical physics, on topics ranging from mechanics to thermodynamics, as well as basic knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and computer science. In this way they have the opportunity to acquire the scientific method on basic topics and the analytical, algebraic and computer tools for the interpretation and analysis of the relevant topics as well as of experimental data.
During the second year, students complete the knowledge of basic physics, with topics related to electromagnetism and optics, accompanied by the related laboratory experiences, and with elements of analytical and relativistic mechanics, and acquire more advanced mathematical and numerical tools, enabling them to formulate adequate interpretative models.
During the third year, students broaden their basic knowledge in modern physics, from quantum mechanics to the structure of matter, with related laboratory activities, to nuclear and subnuclear physics and astronomy, and acquire adequate mathematical tools for their discussion, with the possibility of cultural completion in classical physics and history of physics.
During the three-year period they are also able to access other training activities, including those relating to soft skills and Information Literacy, provided by the University of Palermo.
Students have the possibility of further growth and contacts with the world of work by carrying out internships in various institutions including in particular several research institutions in agreement, and through in-depth study of introductory topics to research on the occasion of the final exam.
By means of these educational activities, the Degree Course in Physical Sciences aims at preparing graduates who have skills that are consistent with the qualifying objectives set out in the declaration of class L-30, and who have a preparation with the necessary requisites.
