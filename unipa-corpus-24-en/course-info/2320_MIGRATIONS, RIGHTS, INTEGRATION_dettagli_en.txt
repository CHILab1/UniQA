Educational objectives
The 2nd cycle Degree Course (LM) in “Migration, rights, integration” provides a specialised training about contemporary human mobility, and about the problems related to the interaction with and integration of migrants in host societies, with special attention to Europe and Italy. The course aims at training experts on migration and integration issues, fundamental rights and inclusion, with high-level knowledge of the legal aspects, and able to situate such knowledge in the broader social, geo-historical and economic context. 
The causes and socio-economic impact of human mobility, the different forms of regulation of the circulation of people and the production of borders, the rights of migrants and integration policies will be studied in a multi-level framework of relevant normative sources. The necessary tools will therefore be provided so that students can orient themselves in the different areas of regulation of the subject (international, European, national), critically evaluating the nature, content and effectiveness of policies, norms and institutions relating to migration.
At the end of the course, graduates:
- will possess advanced (not exclusively legal) knowledge concerning the analysis, interpretation, evaluation and management of the main issues related to migratory phenomena and to the integration, with respect, in particular, to the European Union.
- will be able to critically evaluate related policies, rethink assumptions and paradigms, devise and implement complex operational strategies aimed at affirming fundamental rights.
- will be able to analyse the quantitative aspects of migratory dynamics, and to identify their causes and trends.
- will have in-depth knowledge of the rights of migrants, in particular of vulnerable subjects such as foreign minors, and of the rules and policies to prevent discrimination and ensure equal opportunities in an intersectional perspective.
- will master, thanks to the particular attention dedicated to the legal aspects of the phenomena themselves, as well as to the multilevel protection of migrants' rights, the tools in which current national and European policies are articulated.
- will be able to develop projects aimed at countering the risk of exploitation and trafficking of women and minors.
- will possess planning skills in the field of reception and integration.
- will be able to communicate, in written and oral form, the knowledge acquired in English, as well as in Italian, with reference also to disciplinary lexicons.
In line with the specific educational objectives just indicated, the teachings provided in the two years enable students to deal first of all with the socio-economic causes of migratory phenomena, thanks to the involvement of courses in the historical, economic and geographical fields, to then move on to the analysis of the general legal framework of reference (with courses in international, European and constitutional law) and then focus on the rights of migrants in the relationships among private individuals and with public authorities, as well as on the regulation of the conditions and methods of access and permanence (thanks to the teachings in private, criminal, administrative, procedural, labour and philosophical-legal law) and on the strategies of inclusion in a cohesive and plural society (thanks to the  comparative law, sociology and political philosophy subjects).
The teachings have a calibrated approach to the specific educational objectives of the course. The close relationship of complementarity between the involved subjects is also strengthened through the proposal of integrated courses, composed of coherent modules, in which the same theme is addressed starting from different scientific-disciplinary sectors.
From a purely legal perspective, the Course aims to stimulate critical thinking, the practical use of knowledge and field work. Specific teaching of legal clinics is foreseen, but the intersection between theory and practice and the adoption of innovative teaching methodologies is peculiar to several teachings.
Language and Euro-project laboratories are also set up, due to specific needs emerged during consultations with the course stakeholders. In the first case, the aim pursued is to expand the communication skills of graduates who will work in multilingual and intercultural contexts; in the second case the aim is to provide the necessary tools to draw on European resources for the financing of integration projects, protection of rights, etc. Finally, to make the experience of internships at public and private organizations that operate in the sector of rights, integration and reception profitable, specific agreements have been stipulated. Career guidance is also provided, providing information on internship and employment opportunities at European and international institutions.

Skills:
The Course aims at providing the soft and interdisciplinary skills typical of Migration Studies, with a particular attention to legal issues. At the end of the Course, graduates will have the advanced knowledge necessary for the analysis, interpretation, evaluation and management of the main issues related to migratory phenomena and to the integration of foreign citizens. They will be able to evaluate these phenomena in their quantitative aspects, and to identify their causes and trends. Thanks to the specific legal training received, they will be able to interpret and apply the legal tools by means of which national and European policies are implemented. The acquired knowledge and skills will also enable graduates to critically evaluate migration and integration policies, and to contribute to planning and implementing complex operational strategies. Graduates will be able to make use of the acquired skills in a plurality of contexts, both in the public and in the private sector, not only at the national level, but (given that most of the training will be delivered in English) also in international organizations and within the European Union.

Final examination features
The final examination consists in a written dissertation, to be discussed with a Board of Professors of the 2nd cycle Degree Course.
The dissertation must comply with the following rules:
- at least one chapter of the thesis or a summary of ten pages of the same must be written in English.
- the final thesis must deal with the chosen topic, not only from a theoretical point of view, but also in a practical-applicative perspective, through the examination of a specific public policy, a law case, a regulatory document, statistical data (derived from studies, interviews, etc.) and/or through the re-elaboration of the experience gained during the internship.
In the perspective of the interaction between theory and practice, as well as of an ongoing relationship with stakeholders, the writing of theses in which the supervisor is supported by a co-supervisor who is an expert in the subject (representatives of NGOs; officials of public administrations and international organizations) is also encouraged.
